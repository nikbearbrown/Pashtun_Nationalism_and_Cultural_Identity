# Pashtun Nationalism and Cultural Identity: A Historical and Literary Perspective

### Abstract
This survey paper explores the evolution and expressions of Pashtun nationalism through historical and literary lenses, highlighting the influential role of Khushal Khan Khattak. By examining various scholarly works, this paper discusses the interplay between Pashtun cultural codes, poetry, and the broader socio-political movements that shape Pashtun identity in Pakistan.

### Introduction
### Introduction

#### Concept of Pashtun Nationalism

Pashtun nationalism is a cultural and political movement that aims to preserve and promote the unique identity and interests of the Pashtun people, who predominantly reside in the regions straddling modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This form of nationalism is deeply rooted in the historical, linguistic, and cultural distinctiveness of the Pashtun ethnic group, which has maintained a strong tribal structure and a distinct social code known as "Pashtunwali" (Understanding Pashtunwali and the Manifestation of Pashtun Nationalism in Pakistan: A Conceptual Analysis, Surat Khan et al., 2019).

The movement has historically oscillated between demands for greater autonomy within the existing national boundaries to calls for a separate Pashtun state, Pashtunistan. The transformation of Pashtun nationalism over time can be seen in its shift from traditional tribal allegiances to more modern political expressions, including involvement in national politics and international discourse. The resurgence of nationalism, particularly through movements such as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, underscores a contemporary re-evaluation of Pashtun identity against the backdrop of national and global politics (The rise of peripheral nationalism in Pakistan and the Pashtun Tahafuz movement, Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al., 2020).

#### Significance of Khushal Khan Khattak

Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689), often heralded as the national poet of the Afghans, stands as a monumental figure in Pashtun history and culture. His life and works embody the essence of Pashtun nationalism during a tumultuous period marked by his opposition to the Mughal Empire. Khattak was not only a warrior and chieftain but also a prolific poet whose writings significantly contributed to the Pashtun cultural renaissance and helped solidify a collective Pashtun identity ("THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PASHTUN’S AND MUGHAL’S AND THE ROLE OF KHUSHAL KHAN KHATTAK," Muhammad Anees Khan, 2019).

Khushal Khan used poetry as a medium to express his political thoughts and to rally the Pashtuns against the Mughal authority, promoting values of independence and resistance that are central to Pashtun nationalism. His works, rich with themes of honor, valor, and resistance, have transcended generations, influencing Pashtun thought and identity up to the present day. Through his poems, Khushal Khan advocated for Pashtun unity and valor, often invoking the Pashtunwali codes of hospitality, justice, and revenge, which reinforced the socio-cultural fabric of Pashtun society (Humanity in the Poems of Khushal Khan, Abdul Halim Osmani et al., 2023).

Furthermore, Khushal Khan's contributions are not limited to his military and poetic endeavors; he is also noted for his efforts in framing the educational discourse within Pashtun society, advocating for learning and knowledge as tools of empowerment and resistance against oppression (Education as Practice of Emancipation: A Critical Study of Educational Approach of Classical Pashto Poet Khushal Khan Khattak, Dr. Barkat Shah Kakar et al., 2022). His emphasis on education highlights his forward-thinking approach, linking educational pursuits with nationalistic goals.

The enduring legacy of Khushal Khan Khattak in Pashtun nationalism is evident in how his literary works continue to inspire modern movements and discussions about Pashtun identity and autonomy, reflecting the deep historical and cultural roots of the Pashtun nationalist movement. His figure represents not only the historical struggle of the Pashtuns but also their ongoing quest for recognition and rights within larger national and international frameworks.

#### Historical Context of Pashtun Nationalism
#### Historical Context of Pashtun Nationalism

The historical context of Pashtun nationalism is richly intertwined with the region's complex political and military history, particularly in its interactions with the Mughal Empire. The Pashtuns, historically known for their martial prowess and strong adherence to tribal customs, have often been at the center of power struggles in South Asia.

**Conflicts and Alliances between Pashtuns and the Mughal Empire**

During the height of the Mughal Empire, the Pashtuns found themselves both as adversaries and allies to the Mughals, reflecting a relationship that was as tumultuous as it was transformative. The Mughals, under emperors like Akbar, sought to extend their control over the strategically crucial and resource-rich Pashtun territories, which led to a series of military campaigns and resistance from various Pashtun tribes. These military campaigns were often met with fierce resistance, as the tribal and decentralized nature of Pashtun society made prolonged warfare and control challenging for the centralized Mughal authority ("THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PASHTUN’S AND MUGHAL’S AND THE ROLE OF KHUSHAL KHAN KHATTAK," Muhammad Anees Khan, 2019).

The Pashtuns did not only resist; at times, they also formed strategic alliances with the Mughals, particularly when it suited regional interests or when they sought to leverage Mughal power against local rivals. These alliances, however, were often fragile and contingent upon the shifting dynamics of power and diplomacy in the region.

**Role of Khushal Khan Khattak in Promoting Pashtun Nationalism**

Khushal Khan Khattak, a chief of the Khattak tribe, emerged as a pivotal figure during this period. Initially serving the Mughals as a military leader, Khushal Khan’s relationship with the empire soured following personal disputes and broader tribal grievances against Mughal policies, which were perceived as oppressive towards Pashtun autonomy. His dissent marked a significant turning point, as he used his considerable influence, both as a warrior and a poet, to incite resistance against the Mughals.

Khushal Khan's advocacy for Pashtun nationalism was deeply rooted in the traditional code of Pashtunwali, which emphasizes values such as honor, hospitality, and justice. His poems and writings began to articulate a clear sense of Pashtun identity that was distinct from the Mughal influence, rallying his people around the concepts of self-rule and tribal unity. His leadership exemplified the Pashtun resistance narrative, embedding a strong sense of nationalism within the cultural psyche of the Pashtuns.

Khushal Khan's role in promoting Pashtun nationalism cannot be understated; he transformed Pashtun resistance into a broader nationalist movement by intertwining it with cultural and poetic expressions that celebrated Pashtun heritage and valorized its struggle for sovereignty. This period of resistance under his leadership not only fortified Pashtun identity but also laid foundational narratives for future nationalist movements within the Pashtun regions.

In summary, the historical context of Pashtun nationalism is marked by a dynamic interplay of conflict and cooperation with the Mughals, with figures like Khushal Khan Khattak central to the narrative. His efforts in fostering a distinct Pashtun nationalism through both armed resistance and cultural production were instrumental in shaping the trajectory of Pashtun socio-political identity, which continues to influence regional politics to this day. His legacy is reflected in contemporary Pashtun nationalist movements, which still draw on the historical and cultural themes he helped to crystallize.

#### Literary Contributions of Khushal Khan Khattak
#### Literary Contributions of Khushal Khan Khattak

Khushal Khan Khattak is not only celebrated as a pivotal historical figure in the context of Pashtun resistance against the Mughal Empire, but also as a foundational poet whose literary contributions have had a lasting impact on Pashtun culture and nationalism. His poetry and prose are integral to understanding how the Pashtun identity has been articulated, preserved, and transmitted across generations.

**Reflection and Perpetuation of Pashtun Cultural Codes in Khushal Khan's Poetry**

Khushal Khan’s poetry is a rich tapestry of Pashtun cultural codes, encapsulating the ethos of Pashtunwali— the traditional Pashtun social code that emphasizes values such as honor, bravery, and justice. His poetic works serve as a cultural repository, preserving the oral traditions and values of the Pashtun people during a period of significant historical upheaval. As noted by Hameedullah Omarkhel et al. (2023), Khushal Khan's poetry vividly captures and perpetuates these cultural codes, making them accessible and resonant to both contemporary and future generations of Pashtuns.

In his poems, Khushal Khan often uses metaphors and allegories derived from the everyday life and environment of the Pashtun people, thus grounding his nationalist sentiments in the familiar landscapes of his audience. His verses on valor and resistance are not just calls to arms but are deeply intertwined with the Pashtun's fierce pride in their land and traditions. By embedding nationalist ideals in cultural expressions, Khushal Khan's poetry has ensured that Pashtun nationalism is perceived not merely as a political stance but as an inherent part of the Pashtun cultural identity.

**Humanity and Education as Tools for Emancipation**

Khushal Khan also explored themes of humanity and education in his works, viewing them as essential tools for the emancipation of the Pashtuns from oppressive rule and ignorance. As discussed by Abdul Halim Osmani et al. (2023), Khushal Khan believed in the power of education to elevate the human spirit and foster a sense of communal identity and purpose among the Pashtuns. His humanist views are evident in his poetry, where he often speaks of justice, equality, and the importance of knowledge.

Khushal Khan’s emphasis on education went beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge; he saw it as a means of empowering the Pashtun people to stand up against exploitation and to better understand their rights and duties. His poetic works encourage critical thinking and self-reflection, advocating for a literate society where informed and educated individuals could contribute to the welfare and improvement of their communities.

Moreover, Khushal Khan's humanistic approach in his poetry transcends ethnic and tribal lines, advocating for a broader understanding of humanity that includes respect for all people regardless of their background. This universal appeal not only broadened the reach of his literary works but also provided a moral foundation upon which he built his arguments for Pashtun nationalism.

**Conclusion**

Khushal Khan Khattak's literary contributions have had a profound impact on the development of Pashtun nationalism and the preservation of Pashtun culture. Through his poetry, he not only reflected and perpetuated the traditional values of Pashtunwali but also used his literary platform to advocate for education and humanistic values as fundamental components of societal emancipation. His works remain a cornerstone of Pashtun cultural identity, resonating with themes of resistance, education, and humanity that continue to inspire and influence the Pashtun nationalist movement today.

#### Pashtunwali and Modern Nationalism
#### Pashtunwali and Modern Nationalism

The role of Pashtunwali, the traditional Pashtun social code, in shaping modern Pashtun nationalism is profound and multifaceted. Pashtunwali, with its complex set of ethical guidelines, cultural norms, and social obligations, has historically been the cornerstone of Pashtun identity and governance. This section explores how these traditional codes influence contemporary nationalist movements and how new movements have transformed the landscape of Pashtun nationalism.

**Role of Pashtunwali in Contemporary Nationalism Movements**

Pashtunwali is a cultural framework that governs the behavior and decision-making processes within Pashtun societies. It encompasses key principles such as hospitality (melmastia), justice (nang), and personal honor (tor), which have been pivotal in maintaining social order and cohesion among Pashtun tribes for centuries. According to Surat Khan et al. (2019), Pashtunwali not only underpins traditional Pashtun society but also serves as a catalyst for contemporary nationalism movements. The resilience and appeal of Pashtunwali lie in its adaptability and relevance, even amidst the political and social changes brought about by modernity.

This traditional code has significantly influenced the formulation of political ideologies among Pashtuns, often providing a cultural justification for resistance against perceived injustices and foreign domination. Pashtunwali's emphasis on justice and honor directly feeds into the narrative of modern Pashtun nationalism, which frequently frames its objectives in terms of redressing historical grievances and achieving fair treatment within the broader national framework of Pakistan. The cultural legitimacy afforded by Pashtunwali enhances the persuasive power of nationalist rhetoric, appealing to deeply ingrained values and identities.

**Impact of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement**

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a recent and notable example of modern Pashtun nationalism, has brought significant attention to issues facing the Pashtun communities in Pakistan, such as military operations, human rights abuses, and the imposition of external controls over tribal areas. As detailed by Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al. (2020), the PTM has utilized the principles of Pashtunwali to mobilize support and advocate for the rights of Pashtuns. The movement's call for justice and accountability resonates strongly with the traditional Pashtun emphasis on nang and tor, enabling it to garner widespread support among Pashtuns, both within Pakistan and globally.

The PTM's rise is a significant marker of how traditional cultural codes like Pashtunwali can be adapted to frame modern political and social movements. By articulating their demands through the lens of Pashtunwali, the PTM leaders ensure cultural coherence and continuity, which strengthens communal bonds and collective action. The movement's impact extends beyond immediate political goals, as it also prompts a reevaluation of Pashtun identity in the contemporary era, challenging stereotypes and advocating for a nuanced understanding of Pashtun issues in national and international arenas.

**Conclusion**

Pashtunwali continues to be a dynamic and influential force in the articulation and development of Pashtun nationalism. Its principles shape the ethos and strategies of contemporary nationalist movements, providing a cultural foundation that enhances their legitimacy and resonance among Pashtun populations. The interplay between traditional codes and modern political demands, exemplified by movements like the PTM, highlights the adaptability and enduring relevance of Pashtunwali in the face of changing political landscapes. This complex relationship between tradition and modernity in Pashtun nationalism not only sustains a unique cultural identity but also drives the ongoing struggle for rights and recognition within the broader Pakistani state.

#### Nationalism and Religious Identity
### Nationalism and Religious Identity

The relationship between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity is complex and has significant implications for regional stability and politics. This section delves into how Pashtun nationalism intertwines with Islamic identity and the ways this interplay influences conflicts and political dynamics in the region.

**Interplay Between Pashtun Nationalism and Religious Identity**

Pashtun nationalism has historically coexisted with a strong Islamic identity, as the Pashtuns are predominantly Muslim. However, the interaction between these two facets of identity is not straightforward and has been influenced by various political, social, and historical factors. R. Saigol (2012) in "The multiple self: interfaces between Pashtun nationalism and religious conflict on the frontier," discusses how Pashtun identity has been constructed and reconstructed over time, often in response to external pressures and internal dynamics. The paper highlights that while Pashtun nationalism draws on cultural and tribal affiliations, it also intersects significantly with religious elements, which can both unify and divide.

Pashtun nationalism often emphasizes traditional values and codes, such as Pashtunwali, which coexist with Islamic principles. However, the interpretation of Islam within Pashtun areas can vary significantly, leading to internal conflicts and differences in how nationalism is expressed. For example, some groups may prioritize ethnic and tribal allegiances over religious unity, whereas others might view their Islamic identity as inseparable from their nationalistic aspirations. This duality can lead to a fragmented identity, particularly on the frontier regions where state influence is limited, and tribal and religious laws dominate.

**Nationalism and Religious Ideologies: Context of Taliban Support**

The relationship between Pashtun nationalism and the Taliban is particularly illustrative of how religious ideologies can shape and be shaped by nationalistic movements. A. Saikal (2010) in "Afghanistan and Pakistan: The Question of Pashtun Nationalism?" explores how the Taliban, originally seen as a primarily religious movement, has also been interpreted as a form of Pashtun nationalism. The Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan and their continued influence in Pashtun regions of Pakistan are often linked to their ability to appeal to both the religious sentiments and the nationalistic feelings of the Pashtun population.

The Taliban's use of Islamic rhetoric intertwined with calls for justice and Pashtun autonomy resonates with widespread sentiments against perceived foreign intervention and domination. This approach has allowed them to mobilize significant Pashtun support, framing their governance and military actions as a defense of Pashtun rights and Islamic principles. The support for the Taliban in these regions can thus be seen as part of a broader pattern where religious and nationalistic identities are merged to create a powerful political narrative that appeals to deep-seated cultural and religious values.

**Conclusion**

The interplay between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity is a key factor in understanding the political and social dynamics of the Pashtun regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This relationship is characterized by a complex overlay of cultural nationalism and religious fervor, which impacts regional conflicts and the geopolitical landscape. The dual appeal to tribal nationalism and religious ideology allows movements like the Taliban to gain and maintain power, illustrating the potent combination of these two forces in shaping the socio-political environment. As such, any analysis of Pashtun nationalism and its future trajectories must consider the nuanced roles that both cultural and religious identities play in shaping the aspirations and politics of the Pashtun people.

### Conclusion
### Conclusion

#### Enduring Impact of Khushal Khan Khattak on Pashtun Nationalism

Khushal Khan Khattak is more than a historical figure; he is a symbol of Pashtun resilience and nationalism. His literary and military endeavors during the 17th century set a foundation for the identity and cultural pride that define Pashtun nationalism today. Through his poetry, Khushal Khan not only chronicled the life and values of his people but also instilled a strong sense of nationalism by emphasizing Pashtun valor, honor, and independence. His works, as discussed in the survey, continue to resonate, serving as a source of inspiration and a cultural touchstone for the Pashtun people ("The Cultural Codes of Pashto in Khushal Khan’s Poetry" by Hameedullah Omarkhel et al., 2023).

Khushal Khan's advocacy for education and enlightened thought, as reflected in his poems about humanity and social justice, underscores his foresight and his contributions to the intellectual heritage of the Pashtuns ("Humanity in the Poems of Khushal Khan" by Abdul Halim Osmani et al., 2023). These elements have perpetuated his influence, making him not only a national poet but a perennial figure in the discourse on Pashtun identity and autonomy.

#### Contemporary Significance of Pashtun Nationalism

In the contemporary geopolitical landscape of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Pashtun nationalism remains a significant and sometimes contentious force. The movement's roots in the tribal and cultural ethos of Pashtunwali have adapted to modern political contexts, where issues of rights, governance, and national integrity are at the forefront. The rise of movements like the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement highlights this adaptation, showcasing a nationalism that, while rooted in historical grievances, seeks to address contemporary issues such as human rights abuses, political representation, and social justice ("The rise of peripheral nationalism in Pakistan and the Pashtun Tahafuz movement" by Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al., 2020).

Moreover, the interplay between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity continues to influence regional politics, particularly in relation to the Taliban and the broader Islamic movements in the area. The dual identity of religious adherence and ethnic nationalism presents both challenges and opportunities for stability and peace in the region ("Afghanistan and Pakistan: The Question of Pashtun Nationalism?" by A. Saikal, 2010). Understanding this interplay is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to navigate the complex socio-political terrain of these nations.

#### Conclusion

Khushal Khan Khattak's legacy and the ongoing narrative of Pashtun nationalism are deeply interwoven into the fabric of South Asian history and culture. The endurance of this nationalism, influenced by both historical figures like Khushal Khan and contemporary movements, reflects a vibrant and evolving identity that continues to shape and be shaped by the geopolitical dynamics of the region. As this survey has shown, the themes of resistance, autonomy, and identity are not only elements of the past but are active and dynamic forces that will likely influence the future of both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Understanding these dynamics offers not only a glimpse into the soul of the Pashtun people but also insights into the broader challenges and opportunities facing the region today.

### Introduction

Pashtun nationalism, characterized by a distinctive blend of ethnic identity, cultural heritage, and political aspirations, has played a significant role in the sociopolitical landscapes of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rooted deeply in the traditional Pashtun code of life known as Pashtunwali, this form of nationalism not only underscores the community's values and social norms but also influences their political actions and reactions to national and international events. The historical evolution of Pashtun nationalism is marked by its adaptive responses to colonial and post-colonial shifts, significantly impacting the regional politics of South Asia.

The geographical spread of the Pashtuns, straddling the porous borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, has led to a unique dynamic where nationalism interweaves with issues of sovereignty, governance, and cultural autonomy. Historically, the Pashtuns have been central to key political developments in the region, including the formation of the state of Pakistan in 1947 and subsequent political upheavals in Afghanistan, ranging from the Soviet invasion to the rise of the Taliban.

This survey paper aims to synthesize insights from various academic studies that explore different facets of Pashtun nationalism. The relevance of the chosen papers lies in their diverse perspectives on how Pashtun nationalism has manifested and evolved, particularly focusing on its implications within the complex political frameworks of Pakistan and Afghanistan. By examining studies that discuss the interplay of Pashtun nationalism with religious movements, state policies, and international conflicts, this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces shaping Pashtun nationalism and its impact on regional stability.

Significantly, the papers selected for analysis cover a range of topics, including the influence of the traditional Pashtun code, Pashtunwali, on nationalist sentiments, the role of religious extremism in redefining nationalist priorities, and the transformation of nationalist aspirations in response to geopolitical pressures and state policies. Each of these studies contributes to a nuanced understanding of Pashtun nationalism, reflecting its complexity and the varying degrees to which it affects and is affected by regional and international politics.

Through this survey, we will explore how historical grievances, cultural affiliations, and political exigencies have collectively shaped Pashtun nationalism, examining its implications for both the internal dynamics of Pakistan and Afghanistan and their relationships with global powers. This comprehensive approach will not only highlight the inherent tensions and challenges within Pashtun nationalism but also underline its potential as a transformative force in one of the most geopolitically sensitive regions of the world.

### Study Summaries

This section of the survey paper examines two pivotal studies that delve into the complex dynamics of Pashtun nationalism, its roots in the traditional Pashtunwali code, and its interplay with religious influences. These studies contribute significantly to our understanding of how Pashtun nationalism has evolved in response to socio-political changes and external influences in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

- **Year:** 2019
- **Venue:** Global Social Sciences Review
- **Key Findings:** The study conducted by Khan, Faheem, and Gul (2019) provides an in-depth analysis of Pashtunwali, a traditional code that governs social conduct among the Pashtuns and reinforces their sense of identity and unity. The researchers highlight how this age-old system continues to be a cornerstone in nurturing and perpetuating Pashtun nationalism. Initially, in the aftermath of Pakistan's independence, there was a strong sentiment among Pashtun nationalists for creating a separate state. However, over the decades, this aspiration has shifted towards a more integrated approach where Pashtun rights and identities are sought to be protected and promoted within the constitutional setup of Pakistan. This study sheds light on the transformation of Pashtun nationalism from a separatist movement to one that seeks to achieve its goals through political and legal frameworks within the existing state structure.

- **DOI:** [10.31703/gssr.2019(iv-iii).30](https://doi.org/10.31703/gssr.2019(iv-iii).30)
- **Year:** 2019
- **Key Findings:** Surat Khan’s research explores the dual influence of nationalism and religion on the Pashtun society. The study particularly focuses on how various political strategies employed by Pakistan, notably the promotion of the Afghan Jihad, have intensified religious extremism within Pashtun regions. This escalation of religious fervor has, in turn, impacted Pashtun nationalism, often undermining its secular nationalist goals. Khan points out that the intertwining of religious extremism with nationalist sentiments has led to a complex scenario where traditional nationalist aspirations are frequently overshadowed or altered by religious ideologies. This paper is crucial in understanding the challenges Pashtun nationalism faces in maintaining its distinct identity amidst the rising tide of religious extremism influenced by both domestic policies and international conflicts.

### Contribution to Understanding Pashtun Nationalism
Together, these studies offer a nuanced perspective on the factors shaping Pashtun nationalism. The first study provides insight into how traditional codes like Pashtunwali facilitate a unique nationalist sentiment that has adapted over time from seeking total independence to integrating within a larger national framework. The second study complements this by illustrating the challenges posed by the intertwining of religious extremism with nationalist sentiments, influenced heavily by geopolitical strategies. Both studies are indispensable for comprehending the multi-layered nature of Pashtun nationalism, marked by a blend of traditionalism and evolving political contexts. These insights are fundamental in crafting policies and strategies that acknowledge the unique cultural and historical contexts of the Pashtuns, aiming for stability and integration without compromising their nationalist and cultural aspirations.

### Thematic Analysis

The thematic analysis of the selected studies provides a deeper insight into the multifaceted nature of Pashtun nationalism, emphasizing the impact of external influences, the significant shift from separatism to rights advocacy, and the complex role of religion in shaping the nationalist discourse. These themes are crucial for understanding the evolution and current state of Pashtun nationalism in the geopolitical contexts of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

#### Impact of External Influences
The studies reviewed indicate that external political dynamics, particularly Pakistan's state policies and international conflicts, have significantly influenced the trajectory of Pashtun nationalism. For instance, the implementation of strategic depth policies by Pakistan during the Afghan Jihad played a critical role in fostering religious extremism, which in turn impacted nationalist sentiments among the Pashtuns (Khan, 2019). These external influences have not only shaped the political landscape but also altered the nature of nationalist movements within the Pashtun communities. This has led to an ongoing struggle for the Pashtuns to balance their ethnic identity aspirations with the changing regional and international politics. Understanding these external influences is pivotal for analyzing the shifts in nationalist strategies, from militaristic approaches to more constitutional and rights-based advocacies.

#### Shift from Separatism to Rights Advocacy
A recurring theme identified in the literature is the shift from separatist movements toward advocacy for rights and integration within the existing political framework of Pakistan. Initially, Pashtun nationalism was characterized by a strong desire for a separate state, as seen in the early post-independence era. However, over the decades, there has been a notable transition towards seeking rights and recognition within the Pakistani constitution (Khan, Faheem, & Gul, 2019). This shift is primarily attributed to the realization that sustainable and peaceful coexistence within Pakistan could be more beneficial in the long run than the pursuit of an independent state, which might lead to prolonged conflict and instability. This evolution in nationalist strategies underscores a pragmatic approach to achieving political and social goals, emphasizing legal and political means over armed struggle.

#### Role of Religion
The intersection of religion and nationalism plays a pivotal role in shaping the identity dynamics within Pashtun regions, acting as both a unifying and divisive force. Khan's (2019) study on the interplay between nationalism and religion highlights how religious ideologies have been manipulated to either support or undermine nationalist movements. The rise of religious extremism, often fueled by geopolitical strategies and internal policies, has challenged the secular foundations of Pashtun nationalism. This complex relationship between religion and nationalism in the Pashtun context reveals the dual role of religion—it can act as a catalyst for mobilizing nationalist sentiments but also as a tool for political manipulation to divert or suppress these sentiments. Understanding this dual role is crucial for addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities that religion presents in shaping nationalist movements.

### Conclusion
This thematic analysis reveals that Pashtun nationalism is not a monolithic entity but a dynamic and evolving ideology shaped by a myriad of external and internal factors. The impacts of external political dynamics, the strategic shift towards rights advocacy, and the intricate role of religion form the core of understanding the current and future directions of Pashtun nationalism. Each theme not only provides insights into the complexities of nationalist movements but also helps in formulating strategies that recognize and respect the unique cultural and political aspirations of the Pashtuns. Understanding these themes is essential for any political analysis or policy-making process aimed at fostering stability and integration in regions inhabited by Pashtun populations.
### Discussion

The findings from the studies on Pashtun nationalism contribute significantly to the broader discourse on ethnic nationalism globally. By examining the nuances of Pashtun nationalism, we can draw parallels and contrasts with other nationalist movements around the world, providing a richer understanding of how ethnic traditions and modern state policies interact to shape these movements.

**Comparison with Global Nationalist Movements:**
Pashtun nationalism, with its deep roots in the Pashtunwali code, shares similarities with other ethnic nationalist movements that are deeply tied to traditional codes of conduct and social norms, such as the Kurdish nationalism in the Middle East or the Basque nationalism in Spain. These movements similarly integrate ancient cultural practices with contemporary political agendas to forge a cohesive identity and political stance that resists assimilation into dominant national narratives.

However, what distinguishes Pashtun nationalism is how it has navigated the dual challenges of external geopolitical pressures and internal state policies. Unlike some nationalist movements that might lean towards seeking complete independence through secession, Pashtun nationalism has evolved from its initial separatist inclinations to a more rights-based approach within the framework of the existing state, akin to the Quebecois in Canada. This evolution reflects a pragmatic adaptation to the realities of modern state geopolitics, where outright secession is often unfeasible.

**Implications for Global Ethnic Nationalism:**
The shift in Pashtun nationalism from separatism to rights advocacy underlines a critical aspect of modern ethnic nationalism: the need to adapt traditional aspirations to contemporary political landscapes. This adaptation can serve as a model for other ethnic groups globally, highlighting the potential for achieving cultural and political autonomy without necessarily pursuing full political independence, which might lead to conflict or international isolation.

### Conclusion

This survey of Pashtun nationalism has revealed several key insights that enhance our understanding of ethnic nationalism in a complex and interconnected world. First, the resilience and adaptability of Pashtun nationalism in the face of changing political dynamics and external pressures demonstrate the dynamic nature of ethnic nationalism. The transition from separatism to rights advocacy within the Pakistani constitution illustrates a strategic shift that balances traditional nationalist aspirations with pragmatic political realities.

Second, the interplay between traditional codes such as Pashtunwali and modern political movements provides a compelling case study of how ethnic traditions can continue to influence contemporary nationalist agendas. This blending of the old and the new highlights the capacity of ethnic nationalism to evolve while still retaining its distinct identity.

Finally, the implications of these findings suggest several areas for further research. One pertinent area is the impact of contemporary geopolitical changes, such as the withdrawal of international military forces from Afghanistan, on Pashtun nationalism. Another area for exploration could be the role of digital media in shaping the narratives and reach of Pashtun nationalist movements, particularly among the diaspora.

Understanding Pashtun nationalism within the broader discourse of nationalism and identity politics not only enriches our knowledge of regional dynamics in South Asia but also contributes to the global understanding of how ethnic groups can navigate their aspirations within increasingly complex international contexts.

# RoshNayya Movement: Legacy of Pir Roshan

### Survey Paper: "The Roshaniyya Sufi Movement and Its Historical Impact in South Asia"

**Abstract:**
This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century in South Asia. The movement played a significant role in the socio-political and religious landscape of the region, particularly in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. This paper synthesizes various scholarly works to explore the movement's origins, its spiritual and political philosophies, the conflicts it engendered, and its lasting impact on regional culture and society.

**1. Introduction**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, emerged in the early 16th century in the rugged terrains of what is now modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This movement quickly established itself as a significant spiritual, cultural, and socio-political force in South Asia. Bayazid Ansari's teachings and his establishment of the Roshaniyya Sufi order were deeply rooted in the mystical concept of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being). This philosophical doctrine, which suggests that all existence is unified in the divine essence, served as a cornerstone for the movement's spiritual framework and distinguished it from other contemporary Islamic and Sufi movements.

#### 1. **Historical Context and Emergence**

The emergence of the Roshaniyya movement must be understood against the backdrop of a period marked by political fragmentation, religious diversity, and social upheaval in South Asia. The 16th century was a time of considerable conflict and change, with the region experiencing the decline of established powers and the rise of new dynasties, such as the Mughals, who sought to consolidate their rule over the diverse religious and ethnic communities. In this milieu, Sufi movements often played crucial roles as mediators and cultural bridges, providing spiritual guidance and social cohesion to their followers. However, the Roshaniyya movement diverged from the mainstream Sufi orders of the time in its approach to both spiritual teachings and socio-political engagement.

Bayazid Ansari, born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, was initially educated in Islamic sciences and Sufi teachings. He later developed his unique interpretation of Sufism, which he sought to propagate through his establishment of the Roshaniyya order. Unlike other Sufi movements that typically emphasized withdrawal from worldly affairs, Ansari's vision was more activist. He aimed to challenge the prevailing religious orthodoxy and the socio-political structures that he perceived as corrupt and unjust .

#### 2. **Foundational Principles: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

The philosophical underpinning of the Roshaniyya movement, "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being," is a concept that posits a monistic view of existence, where all creation is essentially one with the Divine. This idea, originally articulated by the medieval Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, was further developed by Bayazid Ansari to challenge the dualistic notion of separation between God and creation prevalent in orthodox Islamic theology. Ansari's interpretation emphasized that the divine is not only transcendent but also immanent within every aspect of creation, encouraging a direct, personal experience of the divine presence.

Ansari’s teachings advocated for the realization of the divine within oneself and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge through inner experience rather than external rituals or dogmatic adherence to religious laws. This stance was seen as a direct challenge to the ulema (Islamic scholars) who upheld a more literalist and legalistic interpretation of Islam. The Roshaniyya teachings promoted a mystical approach to understanding the Quran and Hadith, emphasizing allegorical and esoteric meanings over literal ones  .

#### 3. **Challenging Religious Orthodoxy and Socio-Political Norms**

The Roshaniyya movement was not merely a spiritual initiative; it was a radical challenge to both the religious orthodoxy and socio-political norms of its time. By advocating a mystical interpretation of Islam that downplayed the importance of religious authority and legalistic adherence, Bayazid Ansari directly confronted the established religious order. The movement's emphasis on personal spiritual enlightenment threatened the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars who derived their power from their role as interpreters of Islamic law and guardians of religious orthodoxy.

Additionally, the Roshaniyya movement's social and political ideas were revolutionary for their time. Bayazid Ansari envisioned a society where spiritual and temporal authority were united under a single moral and mystical framework. This vision included a critique of both the tribal chieftains and the burgeoning Mughal state, whom he saw as corrupt and oppressive. His movement attracted followers from various social strata, including marginalized tribal groups, by offering an alternative vision of community that transcended existing social hierarchies and political allegiances .

The movement’s socio-political activism also manifested in its direct confrontation with local rulers and tribal leaders who opposed Ansari's teachings and perceived the growing influence of the Roshaniyya movement as a threat to their power. This conflict escalated into armed confrontations, marking the movement as one of the few Sufi orders that not only engaged in spiritual discourse but also in active socio-political struggle .

#### 4. **Broader Cultural Implications and Legacy**

The Roshaniyya movement had profound cultural implications that extended beyond its immediate religious and political influence. It played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and literary landscape of the Pashtun regions. The movement's teachings were disseminated not only through oral transmission but also through the development of a distinctive literary tradition. Bayazid Ansari himself authored several works in Pashto, thereby contributing to the development of Pashto literature and cultural identity.

Moreover, the movement's emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual discourse challenged the dominance of Persian and Arabic, which were the languages of the elite and the scholars. This helped elevate the status of the Pashto language and facilitated a broader cultural awakening among the Pashtun tribes. The Roshaniyya movement's promotion of Pashto as a literary and scholarly language had lasting effects on the cultural identity of the region, fostering a sense of unity and distinctiveness among its people .

In conclusion, the Roshaniyya Sufi movement represents a unique chapter in the history of South Asian Islam, blending spiritual mysticism with socio-political activism. It challenged both the religious orthodoxy and the socio-political status quo of its time, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence the cultural and religious landscape of the region.


**2. Origins and Foundational Principles**

### Expanded Section: Origins and Foundational Principles

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a prominent Sufi mystic whose life and teachings significantly shaped the religious landscape of South Asia in the 16th century. Born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, Ansari was exposed to diverse religious and cultural influences from an early age. He received a traditional Islamic education but soon diverged from orthodox teachings, developing his unique interpretation of Sufism, which emphasized direct spiritual experience and personal enlightenment over formal religious rituals and dogma.

#### 1. **The Founding of the Roshaniyya Sufi Order**

The Roshaniyya Sufi order, established by Bayazid Ansari in the first half of the 16th century, was rooted in his desire to promote a mystical understanding of Islam that transcended the rigid orthodoxy of his time. The name "Roshaniyya," derived from the Persian word "Roshani" meaning "light" or "illumination," reflects Ansari's emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and the inner illumination of the soul. This movement was part of a broader trend in Sufism that sought to internalize spiritual practices and focus on the individual's direct relationship with the divine, unmediated by clerical authority.

Ansari's establishment of the Roshaniyya order marked a significant departure from other Sufi orders, such as the Qadiriyya or the Chishtiyya, which were more established and widely accepted within the Islamic world. While these orders also emphasized love and devotion to God, they generally operated within the boundaries of orthodox Sunni Islam. In contrast, the Roshaniyya movement was more radical in its approach, questioning the prevailing socio-religious norms and advocating for a more personal and direct experience of God .

**Supporting Quote:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .

#### 2. **Philosophical Underpinnings: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

Central to the Roshaniyya Sufi order's teachings was the doctrine of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being." This philosophy, which was originally articulated by the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi, posits that all existence is fundamentally one with the divine essence. In other words, every aspect of creation is a manifestation of a single, unified divine reality. Ansari adopted and adapted this concept to develop his mystical framework, emphasizing that the divine is both immanent and transcendent, present in all things yet beyond all things.

This philosophical stance was revolutionary in its implications. It suggested that the divine could be experienced directly by anyone who sought it with sincerity and devotion, without the need for intermediaries like religious scholars or clerics. This was a direct challenge to the religious establishment, which derived much of its authority from its role as the gatekeeper of religious knowledge and practice .

By promoting "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," Ansari encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge through personal introspection, meditation, and self-purification. He taught that the divine presence could be realized within oneself and that true spiritual enlightenment came from recognizing this inner divinity. This teaching was seen as a threat to the established religious order because it diminished the role of external religious rituals and the authority of the clergy, who were often seen as intermediaries between the layperson and the divine .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's foundation was deeply spiritual, focusing on personal enlightenment and mystical experiences as a path to understanding the divine nature of existence. This emphasis on direct experience of the divine was a key characteristic that set the Roshaniyya movement apart from more orthodox Islamic practices, which often emphasized external rituals and adherence to religious law.

### Expanded Section: The "Roshaniyya Movement": A Revolutionary Spiritual and Social Initiative

The "Roshaniyya Movement," founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, represented a bold and revolutionary departure from the established socio-religious norms of its time. This movement was not just an introduction of a new Sufi order but a radical initiative that sought to transform both the spiritual consciousness and the socio-political dynamics of the region. Ansari's vision was deeply intertwined with his critique of the existing religious and social order, which he perceived as corrupt, oppressive, and spiritually bankrupt. 

#### 1. **Challenging the Socio-Political Structures**

Bayazid Ansari's establishment of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was driven by his desire to challenge the entrenched socio-political structures of his time, which he believed hindered true spiritual enlightenment and societal justice. Ansari's teachings critiqued the prevailing power dynamics that favored a small elite—both religious and political—over the general populace. He argued that these elites maintained their control through a rigid interpretation of Islam that emphasized external ritual and compliance with religious laws, rather than personal spiritual development and a direct relationship with the divine.

Ansari viewed these structures as inherently corrupt and sought to dismantle them through a spiritual and social revolution. He taught that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved by breaking free from the constraints imposed by religious orthodoxy and social hierarchies. This involved rejecting the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars (ulema) who were seen as gatekeepers of religious knowledge and were often aligned with political authorities to maintain the status quo .

The "Roshaniyya Movement" was characterized by its dual focus on spiritual and socio-political ideals. On the spiritual front, Ansari promoted a more inclusive and accessible interpretation of Islam that was oriented towards personal enlightenment and direct experience of the divine. This stood in stark contrast to the formalistic and hierarchical approaches prevalent in the established religious institutions of the time, which often emphasized strict adherence to ritual and law over personal spiritual development.

On the socio-political front, the movement advocated for a reformation of societal practices and norms. Ansari's teachings emphasized principles of social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of the region.

#### 3. **Inclusivity and Accessibility in Religious Practices**

One of the revolutionary aspects of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was its emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility in religious practices. Ansari believed that spiritual knowledge and divine experience should not be confined to a privileged few but should be accessible to all, regardless of their social or economic status. This approach was in stark contrast to the prevailing religious practices, which were often characterized by exclusivity and a focus on outward piety and ritual.

Ansari's teachings encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge directly from the divine source, rather than through intermediaries such as clerics or religious scholars. This was a radical departure from the norms of the time, which placed significant power in the hands of religious authorities who controlled access to religious knowledge and practices. By advocating for a direct, personal relationship with the divine, Ansari empowered individuals to take ownership of their spiritual journey, breaking down the barriers that had traditionally kept religious knowledge and experience out of reach for many .

Ansari's teachings were grounded in the belief that all human beings are equal before God, and that social and economic inequalities were artificial constructs that needed to be dismantled. He criticized the social stratification and the caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of his time, arguing that these divisions were contrary to the principles of Islam, which advocated for equality and justice .

Ansari's call for social reform was not just theoretical; it had practical implications for the way his followers organized their communities and interacted with others. The movement encouraged its followers to engage in selfless service, cultivate humility, and treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their social or economic status. This emphasis on social justice and equality resonated with many who were marginalized by the existing socio-political structures, and it helped to attract a diverse following to the movement .

#### 4. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization**

### Expanded Section: Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization

A central theme in Bayazid Ansari's teachings within the Roshaniyya Sufi movement was his profound critique of the prevailing religious orthodoxy. Ansari's approach represented a significant departure from the dominant Islamic scholarly traditions of his era, which were characterized by a rigid, formalistic interpretation of religion that prioritized outward conformity and strict adherence to ritual and dogma. Ansari, however, championed an alternative path focused on self-realization and direct experience of the divine, emphasizing inner spiritual understanding over external religious practices. This advocacy for a more personal and experiential approach to spirituality directly challenged the established religious authorities and resonated deeply with those who felt marginalized by orthodox Islam.

#### 1. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy: A Challenge to Established Authority**

Bayazid Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy was rooted in his observation that the Islamic scholarly community of his time had become overly concerned with maintaining external forms of piety, such as ritual observance and adherence to religious law, often at the expense of cultivating a genuine inner spiritual life. Ansari believed that this rigid formalism resulted in a superficial understanding of Islam, one that emphasized compliance over spiritual growth and personal connection with the divine .

Ansari criticized this approach for being spiritually hollow and disconnected from the true essence of Islam, which he saw as a path to personal enlightenment and inner purification. He argued that the religious establishment's focus on external forms and legalistic interpretations served to maintain their power and control over the faithful, rather than fostering genuine spiritual development. In his view, the religious scholars (ulema) had become gatekeepers of a version of Islam that was more concerned with preserving social order and their own authority than with guiding believers toward true spiritual understanding .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .
- "The study presents a balanced and analytical approach of the teachings and techniques he adopted to propagate among the masses" .

**Reasoning:**
By critiquing the established religious orthodoxy, Ansari directly confronted the power structures of his time, advocating for a return to a more authentic, spiritually focused practice of Islam.

#### 2. **Advocacy for Self-Realization and Direct Experience of the Divine**

Central to the teachings of the Roshaniyya movement was the idea that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved through self-realization and direct, personal experience of the divine. Ansari believed that each individual had the potential to experience God directly, without the need for intermediaries such as clerics or scholars. This emphasis on personal spiritual experience was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time, which often relied on a hierarchical model where religious knowledge and authority were concentrated among the ulema .

Ansari taught that the divine could be found within oneself, and that the path to spiritual enlightenment involved turning inward, seeking the divine presence through meditation, contemplation, and inner purification. This approach was inherently egalitarian, as it suggested that anyone, regardless of their social status or level of religious learning, could achieve spiritual enlightenment through sincere devotion and self-discipline. This was a stark contrast to the prevailing views that emphasized external conformity and adherence to a rigid set of religious laws and rituals as the primary means of religious observance .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

**Reasoning:**
By advocating for self-realization and a direct relationship with the divine, Ansari's teachings offered a more personalized and accessible path to spiritual fulfillment, challenging the established religious norms and appealing to a broader range of followers.

#### 3. **Appeal to Marginalized Communities: Inclusivity and Empowerment**

Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy and his advocacy for self-realization found a receptive audience among those who felt alienated by the formalism and exclusivity of orthodox Islam. His teachings particularly resonated with marginalized communities who were often excluded from the centers of religious and political power. By offering a path to divine understanding that did not depend on formal religious education or adherence to rigid social hierarchies, the Roshaniyya movement provided these communities with a sense of spiritual empowerment and inclusion .

For many, the movement's emphasis on inner spiritual experience over outward ritual offered a way to reclaim their spiritual agency in a religious landscape dominated by scholars and clerics who often acted as gatekeepers to religious knowledge. This appeal to the marginalized was further strengthened by the movement's emphasis on social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions, which were prevalent in the region's tribal societies. Ansari's message of spiritual and social liberation thus found fertile ground among those who were most disillusioned with the existing socio-religious order .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's focus on inclusivity and direct spiritual experience made it particularly appealing to those who were disenfranchised by the prevailing religious and social systems, helping to broaden its base of support.

#### 4. **Impact on Religious Thought and Practice: A New Paradigm**

The Roshaniyya movement's critique of religious orthodoxy and its advocacy for self-realization had a profound impact on religious thought and practice in the region. By challenging the authority of the religious scholars and promoting a more direct, personal relationship with the divine, the movement offered a new paradigm for understanding Islam that was more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This new approach emphasized personal spiritual development over outward conformity, encouraging believers to seek a deeper, more meaningful connection with God .

This shift in focus from external ritual to inner experience represented a significant change in the way religion was understood and practiced. It encouraged a more individualized approach to faith, one that was less dependent on the mediation of religious authorities and more focused on personal spiritual growth. This had the effect of democratizing religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a wider range of people and fostering a more inclusive and spiritually dynamic religious community .

By challenging the established religious authorities and promoting a more direct, personal approach to spiritual experience, Ansari's teachings offered a new way of understanding and practicing Islam that was both more inclusive and more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This emphasis on personal spiritual growth and inner purification helped to democratize religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a broader range of people and providing a powerful alternative to the rigid formalism of orthodox Islam.

#### 5. **Impact and Spread of the Movement**

### Expanded Section: Impact and Spread of the Movement

The Roshaniyya movement, initiated by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, quickly garnered a substantial following among various ethnic and tribal groups in South Asia, particularly among the Pashtuns. The movement’s rapid spread can be attributed to several key factors, including Ansari's charismatic leadership, the revolutionary nature of his teachings, the strategic use of vernacular languages, and the movement's appeal to marginalized communities. These elements combined to create a powerful, grassroots spiritual movement that not only challenged the religious and social norms of the time but also left a lasting legacy in the region’s cultural and religious landscape.

#### 1. **Charismatic Leadership and Revolutionary Teachings**

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a charismatic leader whose revolutionary ideas attracted a diverse array of followers. His teachings emphasized personal spiritual enlightenment, direct experience of the divine, and a critique of the established socio-political and religious orders. This combination of spiritual and social reform was particularly appealing to the Pashtuns, who were the primary ethnic group that rallied around Ansari's vision.

The Pashtuns, living in the tribal areas of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, were drawn to Ansari’s teachings because they resonated with their own experiences of marginalization and their desire for both spiritual and social autonomy. Ansari’s emphasis on equality, social justice, and a more personal, direct relationship with the divine challenged the existing power structures, both religious and political, that often excluded or oppressed them. His ideas provided a framework for resistance against external domination and internal hierarchies, appealing to the Pashtun ethos of independence and self-determination .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s appeal to the Pashtuns and other marginalized groups was not just spiritual but also political, offering a vision of society that was more inclusive and just.

#### 2. **Oral Transmission and Written Works in Pashto**

A critical factor in the spread of the Roshaniyya movement was the use of both oral transmission and written works to disseminate Ansari’s teachings. Oral transmission was a powerful tool in a largely illiterate society, allowing the movement’s ideas to be communicated directly to the people in their own language. Ansari and his followers used poetry, songs, and stories to spread their message, making it accessible to a wide audience. This approach not only ensured the rapid spread of the movement but also helped to build a strong sense of community and shared purpose among its followers .

In addition to oral transmission, Ansari made strategic use of written works in Pashto to solidify the movement’s influence and ensure its legacy. By choosing to write in Pashto, a vernacular language, rather than in Arabic or Persian, which were the languages of the religious and cultural elite, Ansari made a deliberate statement about the accessibility of spiritual knowledge. This decision was significant in challenging the dominance of Arabic and Persian, which were often seen as gatekeepers of religious authority and scholarly prestige .

**Supporting Quotes:**

#### 3. **Emphasis on Vernacular Languages: Challenging Elite Dominance**

The Roshaniyya movement’s emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual teachings was a revolutionary approach that significantly contributed to its spread and impact. At the time, Arabic and Persian were the dominant languages of religious scholarship and were associated with the elite class of Islamic scholars (ulema) and rulers. These languages were often inaccessible to the common people, who spoke their local vernaculars, such as Pashto. By advocating for the use of Pashto in spiritual discourse, Ansari effectively challenged the linguistic hegemony of Arabic and Persian, making religious knowledge more accessible and inclusive .

This emphasis on vernacular languages was not merely a linguistic choice; it was a deliberate political and spiritual strategy aimed at breaking down the barriers that excluded ordinary people from religious and spiritual discourse. It allowed Ansari to communicate directly with the people in their own language, fostering a deeper connection and resonance with his teachings. This approach helped to democratize religious knowledge, empowering those who had been marginalized by the existing socio-religious structures and enabling a more inclusive spiritual community .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

The use of vernacular languages like Pashto in spiritual teachings allowed the movement to reach a broader audience, including those who were often excluded from formal religious education, thus fostering a more inclusive and egalitarian spiritual community.

#### 4. **Grassroots Appeal and Empowerment of Marginalized Communities**

A key factor in the rapid spread of the Roshaniyya movement was its strong grassroots appeal, particularly among marginalized communities who found solace and empowerment in Ansari’s teachings. The movement’s message of spiritual and social liberation resonated with those who felt disenfranchised by the rigid hierarchies of the time, both religious and social. By emphasizing self-realization, direct experience of the divine, and the importance of inner spiritual purity over external ritual, the movement offered a path to spiritual fulfillment that was accessible to all, regardless of social status or formal religious training .

This grassroots appeal was a key factor in the movement's rapid spread and its ability to attract a diverse following. The Roshaniyya movement became a vehicle for social change, promoting values of equality, justice, and spiritual autonomy that resonated deeply with its followers .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya movement's advocacy for direct spiritual experience and self-realization was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time" .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s focus on inclusivity, equality, and spiritual empowerment helped to attract a broad cross-section of society, making it a powerful force for social and spiritual change in the region.

#### 5. **Lasting Legacy and Cultural Impact**

The impact of the Roshaniyya movement extended beyond its immediate spiritual and social influence to leave a lasting legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The movement’s promotion of Pashto as a language of spiritual discourse not only helped to elevate the status of Pashto in the region but also contributed to the development of a distinctive Pashto literary tradition. By fostering a sense of cultural pride and identity among its followers, the Roshaniyya movement helped to shape the cultural and religious consciousness of the Pashtun people .

The movement’s teachings on social justice, equality, and spiritual autonomy continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about Islam and society, highlighting its enduring relevance.

By challenging the existing religious and social hierarchies and promoting a more inclusive and accessible path to spiritual enlightenment, the movement attracted a diverse following and left a profound legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The Roshaniyya movement remains a powerful example of how spiritual and social reform can intersect to create lasting change and inspire future generations.

### Title: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives on Pashtun Nationalism and State Formation in Afghanistan

#### Abstract
This paper examines the intricate dynamics of Pashtun nationalism and its historical and contemporary manifestations, shedding light on its significant influence on the geopolitical landscape of Afghanistan and Pakistan. By tracing the evolution from the foundational myths surrounding the Abdālī Afghans to the modern socio-political movements such as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, this study highlights how historical narratives, cultural practices, and external interventions have shaped Pashtun identity and politics. The interplay between religion and nationalism, particularly influenced by external and internal pressures, reveals the complex relationship that has significantly impacted governance and regional stability. Additionally, the role of women within Pashtunwali provides insight into the gender dynamics at play, reflecting broader changes in societal norms due to conflicts and modern challenges. This survey not only provides a nuanced understanding of Pashtun nationalism but also suggests future research directions to further explore its impact on regional and international relations, highlighting the need for a deeper examination of digital media influences, international politics, and comparative studies with other nationalist movements. Through a comprehensive review of scholarly literature, this paper contextualizes Pashtun nationalism within broader historical and geopolitical frameworks, offering insights into its enduring legacies and evolving challenges.


### 1. Introduction

#### Context and Importance
The geopolitical and historical landscapes of Afghanistan and Pakistan are deeply intertwined with the complex tapestry of Pashtun nationalism. As the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and a significant minority in Pakistan, Pashtuns have historically been central to political and social dynamics in both countries. The significance of understanding Pashtun nationalism extends beyond mere academic inquiry; it is crucial for comprehending the broader regional politics that influence stability, peace, and development in Central Asia.

Pashtun nationalism has not only shaped the internal dynamics of Afghanistan but has also had profound implications for its relationship with neighboring Pakistan. This nationalism is deeply rooted in the ethnic group's history, culture, and social structures, which have been influenced by centuries of migration, conflict, and interaction with external powers. The rise and fall of different political entities in the region, including the Durrani Empire founded by Ahmad Shah Abdālī, the British colonial influence during the Great Game, and the more recent U.S.-led intervention, have all shaped the contours of Pashtun nationalism [[1†source]].

Understanding this nationalism is critical not only for historical accuracy but also for formulating policies that address the challenges of governance, insurgency, and transnational terrorism that frequently intersect with ethnic and nationalistic lines.

#### Survey Scope
This survey paper aims to dissect the multi-faceted phenomenon of Pashtun nationalism through a comprehensive review of scholarly literature, covering several pivotal themes:

1. **Historical Origins of the Abdālī Afghans**: The paper will explore the early history of the Abdālī (later known as Durrani) Afghans who played a pivotal role in the formation of the Afghan state. This includes discussions on their ancestral links, which may connect them to the ancient Hephthalites, and their transformation under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Abdālī, who laid the foundation for modern Afghanistan. The role of historical narratives and mythologies in shaping the identity of the Abdālī Afghans and their influence on Pashtun nationalism will be particularly emphasized, drawing on the findings of Nejatie (2019) [[1†source]].

2. **Role of Pashtunwali**: Pashtunwali, the traditional Pashtun code of honor, deeply influences Pashtun social structure and political organization. This survey will delve into how Pashtunwali has sustained Pashtun identity and nationalism, especially in the face of modern state-building challenges and during periods of conflict. The paper will examine the adaptations and evolutions of Pashtunwali in response to both internal changes and external pressures, as explored in studies like those by Kakar (2004), which investigates the role of women within this code [[2†source]].

3. **Influence of External Forces on Pashtun Nationalism**: Pashtun nationalism has also been significantly shaped by external influences, including British colonial strategies, Pakistani state policies, and the geopolitics of the Cold War and its aftermath. This theme will explore how external interventions have exacerbated, manipulated, or sometimes supported Pashtun nationalism for various strategic ends. Key discussions will include the role of the Afghan Jihad, the influence of global jihadism, and the impact of international aid, drawing on analyses such as those by Khan (2019) and Akhlaq (2022) [[3†source], [4†source]].

Through these themes, the survey will provide a nuanced understanding of Pashtun nationalism's origins, its socio-political roles, and its impacts on regional stability and international relations. The objective is to contextualize Pashtun nationalism within broader historical and contemporary geopolitical frameworks, offering insights into both its enduring legacies and its evolving challenges.

#### Early History of Abdālī Afghans
The Abdālī Afghans, later known as the Durrani, occupy a pivotal place in the history of Afghanistan, being closely linked to the rise of the Afghan Empire under Ahmad Shah Durrani in the mid-18th century. Sajjad Nejatie (2019) provides a comprehensive examination of the prehistory of the Abdālī Afghans, exploring their origins and their integration into the broader socio-political fabric of the region [[1†source]]. Nejatie’s research delves into the prevailing theories about the Abdālī’s connections to the Hephthalites—an ancient confederation known for their domination in the region during the first half of the first millennium CE—and a Sufi saint named Abū Aḥmad Abdāl.

The significance of these connections lies in their impact on the formation of Abdālī identity, which combines elements of ancient tribal legacies with spiritual lineage, thus fostering a unique socio-political narrative that helped consolidate their power within the Afghan-Pashtun tribal system. This narrative not only facilitated their rise to prominence but also helped in the mobilization of tribal alliances that were crucial for the establishment of the Durrani Empire. Nejatie’s work highlights how these historical and mythical origins are instrumental in understanding the dynamics of leadership and loyalty in Pashtun tribal politics, which are deeply intertwined with both historical narratives and mystical affiliations [[1†source]].

#### Modern State Formation
The efforts of Afghan monarchs to consolidate power and their impact on the cultural and administrative landscape of Afghanistan are vividly detailed in the historical analysis by Feldman and Gregorian (1970). Their study focuses on the period marked by significant transitions, particularly under the rule of monarchs such as Abdur Rahman Khan, who is often credited with laying the groundwork for modern Afghanistan [[5†source]].

Feldman and Gregorian explore how these monarchs undertook extensive efforts to build a centralized state, navigating the complex interplay of tribal loyalties, regional divisions, and emerging modern governance challenges. They emphasize the role of monarchial strategies in not only consolidating power but also in modernizing the state apparatus to enhance administrative efficiency and territorial control. This period saw a proliferation of reforms in various sectors including the military, education, and infrastructure, which were aimed at integrating a traditionally fragmented society under a cohesive national framework [[5†source]].

These monarchs, particularly during the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan, employed a combination of diplomacy, strategic marriages, and military campaigns to suppress regional rebellions and to establish a strong centralized authority. The cultural shifts during this era, as discussed by Feldman and Gregorian, were significant as they marked a departure from purely tribal politics to a more structured statehood that sought to align traditional practices with the needs of a modern state. This transition was critical in shaping the political landscape of Afghanistan, setting the stage for future conflicts and negotiations between modernizing forces and traditional tribal structures [[5†source]].

Through these detailed explorations, the survey aims to shed light on the foundational periods of Afghan history, tracing the evolution from tribal confederations under the Abdālī to a centralized Afghan state. These historical insights are essential for understanding the continuous influence of tribal dynamics in modern Afghan politics and the persistent challenges faced in state-building efforts.

### 3. The Interplay of Nationalism and Religion

#### Religious Influence and State Policy
The relationship between nationalism and religion within Pashtun society has been complex and influential, significantly shaped by internal dynamics and external interventions, particularly from neighboring Pakistan. Studies such as those by Surat Khan (2019) and Sayed Hassan Akhlaq (2022) provide insights into how these factors have interacted to influence Pashtun nationalism over the years [[2†source], [6†source]].

Khan’s (2019) analysis highlights how Pakistani state policies, especially during the Afghan Jihad against the Soviet invasion, utilized religious motivations to galvanize the Pashtun population against external threats. This policy not only deepened the religious identity among the Pashtuns but also aligned it with nationalistic fervor, thus creating a complex overlay of religious-nationalist sentiments that have persisted into contemporary conflicts. The support for the Mujahideen by the Pakistani government, driven by strategic depth policies, inadvertently strengthened a form of nationalism that was both religiously charged and deeply rooted in Pashtun cultural codes, impacting the social fabric of the region [[2†source]].

Akhlaq (2022) further explores this interplay by discussing the long-term consequences of these policies on Pashtun nationalism. He suggests that the embedding of religious extremism within nationalist movements has not only altered the traditional secular bases of Pashtun nationalism but has also contributed to ongoing regional instability. This intertwining of religion with nationalistic aims has led to significant challenges in distinguishing between religious fervor and political autonomy, complicating peace and reconciliation efforts in the area [[6†source]].

#### Historical and Religious Policies
Ashraf Ghani's (1978) examination of the religious policies of Pashtun tribesmen during the state-building efforts in the late 19th century sheds light on an earlier period of nationalism development under different circumstances [[7†source]]. Ghani discusses how the establishment of the Afghan state under Abdur Rahman Khan involved the manipulation and utilization of religious policies not for the purpose of proselytization—given that the vast majority were already Muslims—but to consolidate political power and instill a centralized form of governance.

Ghani points out that the religious policy under Rahman Khan was characterized by a strategic integration of Islamic principles with tribal customs, which were not traditionally aligned with the strict interpretations of Sharia law. This selective adaptation of Islamic laws was aimed to legitimize his rule and suppress dissent, effectively using religion as a tool to forge a nascent national identity that transcended individual tribal affiliations [[7†source]]. The outcome was a dual-edged sword; while it strengthened state control and expanded Rahman’s authority, it also laid the groundwork for future conflicts between traditional tribal practices and the centralized Islamic state framework.

### Conclusion
The interplay of nationalism and religion in Pashtun society, particularly as influenced by the policies of neighboring states and historical leaders, presents a multifaceted narrative of how religious identity and political nationalism can co-evolve, often with profound implications for state-building and social cohesion. This historical and contemporary analysis highlights the crucial role of religious policies and state strategies in shaping not only Pashtun nationalism but also the broader geopolitical stability of the region. As evidenced in the works of Khan, Akhlaq, and Ghani, understanding these dynamics is essential for addressing the ongoing challenges and opportunities within Pashtun regions today.

### 4. Modern Manifestations of Pashtun Nationalism

#### Pashtun Tahafuz Movement
The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) has emerged as a significant and contemporary expression of Pashtun nationalism, advocating for the rights and protections of Pashtuns in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. As discussed by Raja Qaiser Ahmed and R. Khan (2020), the PTM has arisen largely as a response to the prolonged violence and socio-political neglect that Pashtuns have endured due to regional conflicts, particularly the war on terror and the activities of militant groups in tribal areas [[8†source]].

The PTM's rise reflects a shift in Pashtun nationalism from a historically fragmented tribal allegiance to a more consolidated civil rights movement. This shift is indicative of a broader transformation within Pashtun society, where traditional tribal and religious affiliations are being reinterpreted in the context of modern statehood and global human rights discourse. The movement leverages social media and peaceful protest as primary tools for activism, distinguishing itself from previous forms of nationalism that often relied on armed resistance or tribal warfare [[8†source]].

This new form of nationalism is not only a reaction to the immediate grievances such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and discrimination but also a broader demand for the reintegration of Pashtuns into the political mainstream of Pakistan, ensuring their rights and dignities are protected under the national constitution.

#### Challenges of Pashtun Nationalism
The complexities of Pashtun nationalism, particularly in relation to the phenomena of Talibanization and the enduring influence of tribal politics, have been detailed in studies by R. Saigol (2012) and S. Haroon (2019). These studies provide a nuanced view of how Pashtun nationalism interacts with and sometimes contradicts the narratives and practices of religious extremism propagated by movements like the Taliban [[9†source], [10†source]].

Saigol (2012) explores the tendency among some scholars and policymakers to equate Pashtun nationalism with Talibanization, arguing that this oversimplification overlooks the diverse political and ideological expressions within Pashtun communities. Saigol posits that while certain segments of the Pashtun population may support the Taliban for various reasons, including geopolitical and economic motives, this does not imply a universal alignment of Pashtun nationalism with the Taliban’s objectives or methods [[9†source]].

On the other hand, Haroon (2019) examines the interaction between Pashtun tribalism and religious ideologies, noting that the relationship is far more complex than commonly perceived. He argues that the portrayal of Pashtun society as uniformly tribal and religiously conservative fails to account for the dynamic changes and ideological diversity within the community, especially in the context of globalization and modern state politics [[10†source]]. Haroon's work highlights the multiple layers of identity and allegiance that define Pashtun nationalism, which can sometimes be in conflict with the radical agendas pursued by groups like the Taliban.

### Conclusion
The modern manifestations of Pashtun nationalism as represented by movements like the PTM and the academic discourses challenging the conflation of Pashtun identity with Talibanization illustrate the evolving nature of nationalist expressions among the Pashtuns. These developments signify a critical juncture in the history of Pashtun nationalism, reflecting broader socio-political changes and the impact of prolonged regional conflicts. Understanding these manifestations is crucial for developing informed and effective policies that address the complex realities of Pashtun communities today.

#### 5. Gender and Legislative Authority within Pashtunwali

#### Role of Women
Pashtunwali, the traditional Pashtun code of honor and conduct, has been instrumental in defining the social and legal norms within Pashtun communities. However, the role of women within this framework has often been overlooked or minimized in broader discussions of Pashtun society. Palwasha L. Kakar's 2004 study provides a critical examination of how women navigate and influence these traditional structures, particularly in the context of legislative authority [[11†source]].

Kakar explores the "ideal" Pashtunwali as envisioned by both Pashtun men and women, acknowledging that while the code is predominantly interpreted and enforced by men, women also play a significant, albeit often indirect, role in its perpetuation and evolution. Her analysis highlights how conflict, war, and displacement have not only disrupted traditional practices but also opened spaces for women to renegotiate their roles and authority within the tribal framework [[11†source]].

The impact of external pressures such as displacement due to conflict has led to significant alterations in how Pashtunwali is practiced and perceived. Women, often left to manage households in the absence of men who are either at war or have migrated for work, have found themselves in positions where they must take on roles traditionally reserved for men. This shift has gradually led to a reevaluation of women's capabilities and their potential contributions to legislative processes within Pashtun society.

Kakar's study also addresses the layers of legislative authority that women can exercise under Pashtunwali. This authority is not typically formal or overt but operates within gender-segregated networks and occasionally crosses these boundaries to influence broader community decisions. Women's participation in jirgas (tribal councils), although not widespread, serves as a testament to the evolving dynamics of gender roles within Pashtun communities. This participation, although still contested and heavily restricted, marks a critical step toward more inclusive governance practices that recognize women's voices as integral to societal leadership and decision-making [[11†source]].

### Conclusion
The exploration of women's roles within the Pashtunwali system reveals a complex interplay between tradition and change, where gender norms are both challenged and reinforced by the realities of modern conflict and displacement. Kakar's insights into the nuanced ways in which Pashtun women negotiate their positions within these traditional structures provide a vital perspective on the adaptive nature of cultural codes in response to socio-political upheavals. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any comprehensive analysis of Pashtun society, especially in discussions aimed at fostering greater gender equity and inclusion in tribal and national legislative processes.

### 6. Conclusion

#### Summary of Key Findings
The exploration of Pashtun nationalism through various scholarly works reveals a multifaceted phenomenon shaped by historical, cultural, and political influences. Key findings from the literature underscore the complexity and diversity of Pashtun nationalism, highlighting its evolution from the tribal and dynastic origins of the Abdālī Afghans to the contemporary manifestations in movements like the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM).

1. **Historical Roots and Evolution**: Studies such as those by Nejatie (2019) provide an in-depth look at the historical narratives surrounding the Abdālī Afghans, illustrating how ancient tribal affiliations and mystical traditions have played a pivotal role in shaping Pashtun identity and leadership dynamics [[1†source]]. The consolidation of power under figures like Ahmad Shah Durrani marked the early state-building efforts that fused Pashtun tribal norms with the emerging demands of a centralized state, as detailed by Feldman and Gregorian (1970) [[5†source]].

2. **Religious and Nationalist Interplay**: The interplay between nationalism and religion has significantly influenced Pashtun society, particularly in response to external pressures such as Pakistani state policies and the Afghan Jihad. Authors like Khan (2019) and Akhlaq (2022) discuss how these elements have been leveraged to galvanize nationalist sentiments that are both protective and assertive of Pashtun identity in the face of geopolitical challenges [[2†source], [6†source]].

3. **Modern Nationalism and Civil Rights Movements**: The rise of the PTM signals a new phase of Pashtun nationalism, characterized by a shift towards civil rights advocacy and the use of modern communication tools to address grievances. This movement reflects a broader transformation within Pashtun society towards advocating for rights and recognition within national and international frameworks, as analyzed by Ahmed and Khan (2020) [[8†source]].

4. **Gender Dynamics within Pashtunwali**: The role of women within Pashtunwali, as explored by Kakar (2004), highlights the evolving nature of gender roles within traditional codes. Conflicts and social changes have prompted a reassessment of women's roles, suggesting a slow but notable shift towards greater gender inclusivity in legislative processes within Pashtun society [[11†source]].

#### Implications for Future Research
The findings from this survey suggest several areas for future research that could further elucidate the complexities of Pashtun nationalism and its socio-political implications:

1. **Impact of Globalization and Digital Media**: Future studies could explore how globalization and digital media are influencing Pashtun nationalism. The role of social media in movements like the PTM offers a rich area for investigation, particularly in how these platforms are used to negotiate identity and mobilize support across transnational Pashtun communities.

2. **Intersection of Nationalism and International Relations**: Further research could examine the impact of contemporary political changes in Afghanistan and Pakistan on Pashtun nationalism. This includes the role of international actors and neighboring states in shaping the political landscape that affects Pashtun areas.

3. **Longitudinal Studies on Gender Roles**: There is a need for longitudinal studies that track changes in gender roles within Pashtun society, especially in the context of ongoing conflicts and socio-economic changes. Understanding how these roles evolve can provide deeper insights into the internal dynamics of Pashtunwali and its adaptation to modern pressures.

4. **Comparative Studies with Other Nationalist Movements**: Comparing Pashtun nationalism with other regional and global nationalist movements could provide additional insights into the unique and common elements that drive ethnic and nationalist sentiments in different socio-political contexts.

These areas of future research not only promise to deepen our understanding of Pashtun nationalism but also contribute to broader discussions on ethnicity, nationalism, and state dynamics in multi-ethnic states.

### Introduction

The study of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement is crucial for understanding the complexities of nonviolent resistance within the context of South Asian political and social dynamics. The movement, which emerged in the early 20th century, represents a significant chapter in the history of the Indian subcontinent's struggle against colonial rule. Led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a close ally of Mahatma Gandhi, the Khudai Khidmatgar (which translates to 'Servants of God') was distinctive for its commitment to nonviolent protest and its deep roots in the cultural and religious ethos of the Pashtun community (Banerjee, 2000).

This movement is particularly notable for its synthesis of Islamic principles with the strategies of nonviolent civil disobedience pioneered by Gandhi. Abdul Ghaffar Khan believed that the teachings of Islam aligned closely with the principles of nonviolence, and he leveraged this interpretation to mobilize the predominantly Muslim Pashtuns against British colonial rule (Rowell, 2009). The movement's foundation on nonviolent resistance was not only a strategic choice but also a profound ideological commitment, which was inspired by Gandhi’s success in promoting nonviolence among diverse Indian communities. This approach was revolutionary, especially in a region where martial prowess was traditionally celebrated and formed a core component of Pashtun identity.

The relevance of studying the Khudai Khidmatgar movement extends beyond historical interest; it offers insights into how nonviolent principles can be integrated into diverse cultural and religious frameworks. The movement challenged and redefined the norms of Pashtun society, which had been characterized by a strong warrior tradition. By advocating for nonviolence, Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his followers not only provided a new model of resistance but also demonstrated the potential for profound social transformation within a highly traditional society (Banerjee, 2000).

Moreover, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement's commitment to nonviolence under challenging circumstances and in a highly volatile geopolitical area offers valuable lessons for contemporary movements worldwide. It stands as a testament to the power of nonviolent resistance, even in contexts where such an approach seems counterintuitive. Thus, studying this movement not only enriches our understanding of South Asian history but also contributes to the global discourse on peace, resistance, and social change.

In summary, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement is not only a critical historical case of the interplay between nationalism, religion, and nonviolent resistance but also a resonant example for current and future generations seeking peaceful methods to achieve social and political objectives. The movement’s foundation in Gandhian principles, while uniquely adapted to the Islamic and Pashtun context, offers a compelling narrative of how universal ideas of nonviolence can be localized to fit different cultural and political landscapes (Rowell, 2009; Banerjee, 2000). This makes the study of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement both relevant and necessary for scholars, policymakers, and activists alike.

### Historical Context and Emergence

#### Historical Background

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement, founded by Abdul Ghaffar Khan in the 1920s in the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan), arose during a period marked by intense political agitation against British colonial rule. This movement was a direct response to the oppressive policies imposed by the British and aimed at mobilizing the Pashtun community towards a nonviolent struggle for independence. The movement, initially started as a social reform group, rapidly transformed into a political entity advocating for the rights and self-determination of the Pashtuns under the banner of nonviolent resistance (Bala, 2013).

The core principles of the Khudai Khidmatgar were deeply influenced by Gandhian ideals of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance), which Abdul Ghaffar Khan encountered during his extensive interactions with Mahatma Gandhi. Khan adapted these principles to the Pashtun context, emphasizing the compatibility of nonviolence with Islamic teachings, thus crafting a movement that was both revolutionary and deeply rooted in the local religious and cultural milieu. This synthesis of nonviolent resistance with Islamic legitimacy was crucial, as it provided a culturally resonant strategy for mobilization and resistance against colonial rule (Banerjee, 2000).

#### Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s Leadership

Abdul Ghaffar Khan, often revered as ‘Frontier Gandhi’, was instrumental in shaping the movement’s direction and strategy. His charismatic leadership and firm commitment to nonviolence were central to the movement's identity and appeal. Khan’s approach was groundbreaking in that he successfully mobilized the traditionally martial Pashtun tribes towards peaceful protests, which was a stark departure from their historical reliance on armed struggle. He established a rigorous code of conduct for the Khudai Khidmatgars, who were required to take oaths to serve humanity and abstain from violence, thus reinforcing the movement's commitment to peace and ethical conduct (Rowell, 2009).

Khan's leadership was not just strategic but also visionary. He envisioned a society where justice and equality prevailed, transcending tribal and sectarian lines. This vision was embedded in the daily practices and educational programs of the Khudai Khidmatgar, which sought not only to resist colonial oppression but also to uplift and educate the Pashtun populace. Under his guidance, the movement set up schools, advocated for women's rights, and promoted a new social ethic among the Pashtuns, centered on nonviolence and civic responsibility (Rowell, 2009).

#### Mobilization of Pashtun Polity

The mobilization strategy of the Khudai Khidmatgar was multifaceted, involving grassroots organizing, community engagement, and the establishment of a parallel structure to British colonial administration. The movement's use of Jirgas (traditional Pashtun assemblies) and its emphasis on Islamic principles helped in legitimizing its activities and appeals among the conservative Pashtun tribes, who might otherwise have been skeptical of radical political changes. By framing the struggle for independence within the familiar context of Islamic teachings and Pashtun social structures, Khan was able to mobilize a significant portion of the Pashtun polity towards nonviolent activism (Bala, 2013).

Moreover, the movement’s emphasis on nonviolence was critical during a time when the subcontinent was fraught with communal and sectarian violence. By steadfastly adhering to nonviolent methods, the Khudai Khidmatgar not only set itself apart from other contemporary movements but also demonstrated the effectiveness and moral high ground of peaceful resistance. This stance was particularly significant in maintaining a focus on the broader goal of independence while avoiding the communal tensions that were escalating in other parts of India (Banerjee, 2000).

In conclusion, the historical emergence of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement under Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s leadership is a profound example of how deeply held cultural and religious values can be harmonized with radical political objectives. The movement's integration of nonviolence, Islamic legitimacy, and Pashtun traditions created a powerful and enduring legacy in the struggle against colonial oppression and in the broader discourse on nonviolent resistance.



### Ideological Underpinnings

#### Connection to Islamic Principles and Gandhian Nonviolence

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement represents a unique synthesis of Islamic teachings and Gandhian nonviolence, which served as a powerful ideological foundation for mobilizing the Pashtun society towards peaceful resistance. Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the leader of the movement, believed that the principles of Islam inherently supported nonviolence and peace. He often quoted the Quran and Hadiths to emphasize that Islam advocates for peace, mercy, and compassion towards all beings. This reinterpretation of Islamic texts was instrumental in gaining the support of the deeply religious Pashtun communities, who respected religious scholarship and were more likely to engage in a movement that aligned with their faith (Banerjee, 2000).

Simultaneously, the movement drew heavily from Gandhian principles of Satyagraha (truth-force) and Ahimsa (non-harm). Ghaffar Khan had closely collaborated with Mahatma Gandhi and was deeply influenced by his methods of civil disobedience. By integrating these principles with Islamic tenets, Ghaffar Khan provided a culturally contextualized version of nonviolence that was not seen as foreign or imposed but as an extension of the community's own religious beliefs. This approach not only legitimized the movement but also transformed the traditionally martial Pashtun society, which had a storied history of warrior culture, towards embracing nonviolent action as a viable and honorable strategy in political resistance (Banerjee, 2000).

#### Dual Influence of Religion and Regional Nationalism

The ideological framework of the Khudai Khidmatgar was also deeply influenced by the dual forces of religion and regional nationalism. While Islam provided the ethical and moral foundation for the movement, the concept of Pashtun nationalism fueled its political aspirations and objectives. This nationalism was not merely based on ethnic identity but was also a response to the specific socio-political conditions in the North West Frontier Province under British colonial rule. The Pashtuns' desire for self-determination was intertwined with their religious identity, which was seen as under threat by foreign domination and cultural imposition (Khan et al., 2019).

Ghaffar Khan and his movement capitalized on this sentiment by advocating for a Pashtun state where Islamic principles and Pashtun cultural values would govern society. This vision of a harmonious blend of religious adherence and regional autonomy resonated deeply with the Pashtuns, who felt a strong sense of alienation and marginalization under British rule. The Khudai Khidmatgar thus not only fought against colonial oppression but also for the preservation and promotion of Pashtun cultural and religious identity within the broader framework of Indian nationalism (Khan et al., 2019).

The movement's ability to navigate these dual influences effectively enabled it to maintain a strong base of support among the Pashtuns. By framing their struggle in both religious and nationalistic terms, the Khudai Khidmatgar aligned its goals with the prevailing sentiments and priorities of the Pashtun people. This strategic alignment was crucial in mobilizing a large segment of the Pashtun population, who saw the movement's goals as reflective of their own aspirations for religious freedom and political self-rule (Khan et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the ideological underpinnings of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement are a testament to the complex interplay of religion and nationalism within the context of nonviolent resistance. By adeptly blending Islamic principles with Gandhian nonviolence and Pashtun nationalism, the movement not only transformed a warrior society but also left a lasting legacy on the regional and national movements that followed. This ideological sophistication highlights the movement's historical significance and its enduring relevance in studies of political and social mobilization.

### Political Impact

#### Role in the Indian Independence Struggle

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement, under the leadership of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, played a significant and influential role in the broader Indian independence struggle. The movement's commitment to nonviolence and its mass mobilization of the Pashtun population in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) were crucial in challenging British colonial authority in a strategically important region. Ghaffar Khan's alliance with Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress further integrated the Pashtun resistance into the national framework of the independence movement, enabling a cross-cultural alliance that bolstered the national struggle against British rule (Gilmartin and Jansson, 1983).

The movement not only participated in national campaigns like the Civil Disobedience Movement but also localized these efforts within the Pashtun areas, adapting them to local cultural and social contexts. This integration of local movements into the national struggle was pivotal in creating a unified front against colonialism across diverse ethnic and cultural lines, which was essential for the success of the broader independence movement (Nichols, 1999).

#### Impact on Pashtun Nationalist Sentiments

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement significantly shaped Pashtun nationalist sentiments by promoting a distinct identity that was both part of the Indian nationalist framework and uniquely Pashtun. The movement fostered a sense of Pashtun nationalism that was tied to broader anti-colonial goals, yet it also emphasized unique cultural and political aspirations of the Pashtuns. This dual identity played a significant role in the post-independence period, as Pashtun nationalism continued to influence political dynamics in the region (Gilmartin and Jansson, 1983).

The articulation of a Pashtun identity that was distinct yet aligned with the Indian freedom struggle helped in nurturing a political consciousness that transcended mere anti-colonial sentiment and sought greater autonomy and recognition within the emerging nation-states of India and Pakistan. The legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement in fostering this nationalist sentiment has had lasting implications for the political landscape in both countries, particularly in regions inhabited by Pashtuns (Nichols, 1999).

#### Tensions with the Pakistani State

Following the partition of India in 1947, the political landscape dramatically shifted for the Pashtuns. The Khudai Khidmatgar, which had opposed the creation of Pakistan, found itself in a complex relationship with the new Pakistani state. The movement's strong advocacy for Pashtun nationalism often clashed with the centralizing tendencies of the Pakistani government, which viewed regional nationalisms as a threat to national unity. These tensions manifested in various political and social conflicts, highlighting the challenges faced by regional movements in adapting to the new political realities of post-colonial South Asia (Jansson, 1991).

The suppression of Pashtun nationalist expressions by the Pakistani state further complicated the political impact of the Khudai Khidmatgar legacy. However, it also underscored the deep-rooted resilience and continuity of Pashtun nationalist aspirations, which have periodically resurfaced in various forms and movements throughout Pakistan's history (Ahmed and Khan, 2020).

#### Influence on Subsequent Nationalist Movements

The ideological and organizational foundations laid by the Khudai Khidmatgar have influenced subsequent nationalist movements in the region, particularly those advocating for greater rights and recognition for Pashtuns within Pakistan. Movements like the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) in contemporary Pakistan draw direct inspiration from the nonviolent resistance philosophy of the Khudai Khidmatgar. These movements continue to advocate for civil rights, social justice, and political autonomy, reflecting the enduring legacy of Ghaffar Khan's vision and the movement's foundational principles (Ahmed and Khan, 2020).

In conclusion, the political impact of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement is profound and multifaceted, spanning across decades and influencing a wide range of political dynamics and nationalist sentiments in South Asia. Its role in the Indian independence struggle, its shaping of Pashtun nationalist sentiments, and its complex interactions with the Pakistani state illustrate the enduring influence and significance of this movement in the region's political history.

### Legacy and Continuing Influence

#### Long-term Legacy in Modern Pashtun Nationalism

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement, under the stewardship of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, has left a profound and enduring legacy within the sphere of Pashtun nationalism. Its integration of nonviolent resistance with Islamic principles and Pashtun cultural values has significantly shaped the political ethos of the Pashtun regions across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This legacy is particularly evident in the ongoing pursuit of Pashtun rights and autonomy within the geopolitical landscape of contemporary Pakistan, where Pashtun nationalism continues to be a vital force in both local and national politics.

One of the most tangible manifestations of this legacy is the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), which has emerged as a significant socio-political movement advocating for the rights and protections of Pashtuns in Pakistan. The PTM, much like the Khudai Khidmatgar, combines a strong emphasis on nonviolent protest with a call for justice and accountability, particularly in response to state violence and discrimination. The ethos and tactics of the PTM echo the Khudai Khidmatgar's approach, highlighting the continued relevance of Ghaffar Khan's principles in addressing contemporary issues facing Pashtuns (Ahmed and Khan, 2020).

#### Influence on Contemporary Political and Social Movements

The historical narratives of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement have played a significant role in shaping contemporary political and social movements among Pashtuns. These narratives, which portray the movement as a symbol of Pashtun unity, resistance, and ethical governance, continue to inspire new generations of activists and leaders within the Pashtun community. The story of the Khudai Khidmatgar is often invoked in contemporary political discourse as a reminder of the power of nonviolent resistance and the importance of aligning political action with ethical and religious principles (Titus and Swidler, 2000).

This historical memory has helped to foster a sense of collective identity and purpose among Pashtuns, particularly in the context of their complex relationship with the Pakistani state and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. The legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar thus serves as both a foundation and a touchstone for contemporary movements, providing a framework for understanding and addressing the challenges faced by the Pashtun community today.

Moreover, the principles and strategies of the Khudai Khidmatgar have been adapted to modern contexts, where issues such as human rights, political representation, and cultural preservation are at the forefront of the Pashtun political agenda. These adaptations are evident in the way modern movements articulate their demands and organize their activities, reflecting the deep-rooted influence of the Khudai Khidmatgar's approach to political engagement (Ahmed and Khan, 2020).

#### Educational and Cultural Impact

Beyond its political implications, the legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement extends into the realms of education and culture. The movement's emphasis on literacy and education as tools for empowerment has inspired ongoing educational initiatives among Pashtuns. Additionally, the movement’s investment in cultural preservation and promotion has encouraged contemporary efforts to document and celebrate Pashtun history and traditions, reinforcing a sense of pride and identity within the community.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement is a pervasive and dynamic force in the fabric of Pashtun society. Its historical and ongoing influence on political and social movements demonstrates the enduring power of its foundational principles. As contemporary movements like the PTM continue to draw on the legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar, it is clear that the movement’s ethos of nonviolent resistance, combined with its deep cultural and religious resonances, remains a potent and relevant force in shaping the trajectory of Pashtun nationalism and advocacy.

### Conclusion

#### Significant Contributions to Pashtun Nationalism and Nonviolent Resistance

The Khudai Khidmatgar movement, under the inspiring leadership of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, stands as a monumental example of how deeply ingrained cultural and religious values can be harnessed to fuel a powerful nonviolent resistance movement. Its contributions to Pashtun nationalism are profound, as it not only mobilized the Pashtun population against British colonial rule but also galvanized a broader recognition of Pashtun identity, unity, and political aspirations. This movement effectively intertwined Pashtun cultural pride with the mechanics of national and anti-colonial struggle, setting a precedent for future nationalist movements within the region.

In the broader field of nonviolent resistance, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement's adherence to and promotion of nonviolence—rooted in both Islamic principles and Gandhian philosophy—offered a unique model that demonstrated the effectiveness of peaceful methods in achieving political and social objectives. The movement's commitment to nonviolence was particularly significant in a region characterized by tribal conflicts and colonial oppressions, proving that nonviolent strategies could transcend cultural and historical norms of violence (Banerjee, 2000).

#### Continuing Relevance in the Contemporary Political Landscape

The principles espoused by the Khudai Khidmatgar movement continue to resonate within the contemporary political landscape of the region, especially amid ongoing challenges faced by the Pashtun communities in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Modern movements such as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) draw direct inspiration from the Khudai Khidmatgar, adopting similar strategies of peaceful protest to advocate for civil rights, social justice, and accountability from governmental authorities (Ahmed and Khan, 2020). This demonstrates the enduring relevance of the movement's foundational principles as tools for contemporary political activism and social reform.

Moreover, the historical narrative of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement serves as a beacon for broader regional efforts towards peace and reconciliation in South Asia, a region often plagued by political instability and conflict. The legacy of nonviolence left by the Khudai Khidmatgar provides valuable lessons in how deeply divided societies can pursue peace through inclusive and principled leadership.

The ethos of the Khudai Khidmatgar, emphasizing ethical conduct, community service, and nonviolent resistance, remains a potent force in shaping discussions around national identity, regional autonomy, and political participation. As new generations of activists and leaders emerge within the Pashtun communities, the principles of the Khudai Khidmatgar offer guiding lights for navigating the complexities of modern political realities while staying true to the values of peace and justice.

### Summary

In summary, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement not only played a pivotal role in the historical context of the Pashtun nationalist movement but also left an indelible mark on the philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance worldwide. Its integration of cultural identity with political activism continues to inspire and inform current and future generations, underscoring the timeless relevance of its principles in advocating for peace and justice in complex socio-political landscapes.

### Introduction

#### Background
Pashtun nationalism in Pakistan is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that has evolved significantly since the country's independence in 1947. Historically, Pashtuns, an ethnic group primarily residing in the regions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, have maintained a distinct cultural identity, articulated through the traditional code of Pashtunwali. This code, which emphasizes honor, hospitality, and justice, has long been a cornerstone of Pashtun identity and a binder of their collective nationalism (Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, & S. Gul, 2019).

Initially, Pashtun nationalism was primarily characterized by a desire for a separate state, as evidenced in the early post-independence period when leaders like Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan advocated for the creation of Pashtunistan, encompassing Pashtun territories across both Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, the failure to achieve a separate state led to a significant shift in the nature of Pashtun nationalism. Over the decades, the focus transitioned from separatism to securing and advocating for constitutional rights within the framework of the Pakistani state (Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, & S. Gul, 2019). This transformation in the nationalist agenda reflects a broader trend of adaptation and pragmatism among Pashtun political movements.

#### Purpose
This paper seeks to delve into the diverse scholarly perspectives on Pashtun nationalism to understand its various manifestations and the implications thereof. Recent years have seen a notable shift towards a more inclusive and expansive form of nationalism, often referred to as neo-ethnonationalism, which attempts to reconcile traditional ethnic identity with the modern demands of state and global integration (Husnul Amin, 2023). This neo-ethnonationalism is not just a resurgence of ethnic pride but also a strategic adaptation to the geopolitical dynamics of the region.

Moreover, the interplay between nationalism and religious dynamics within the Pashtun context has become increasingly significant. The rise of religious extremism, influenced by decades of geopolitical conflict and the Afghan Jihad, has reshaped the landscape of Pashtun nationalism. The intertwining of religious fervor with nationalist sentiments, particularly in the context of movements such as the Taliban, challenges the traditional secular roots of Pashtun nationalism and suggests a complex interaction between ethno-national identity and religious ideologies (A. Saikal, 2010; Surat Khan, 2019).

In exploring these dimensions, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Pashtun nationalism's evolution and its current state, highlighting the nuanced ways in which Pashtuns have navigated their identity politics within the broader Pakistani and regional context. The analysis will draw upon a range of scholarly works to offer insights into how these dynamics affect the stability, socio-political fabric, and future trajectories of both the Pashtun regions and Pakistan as a whole.

### Historical Context and Evolution

#### Early Nationalism
The roots of Pashtun nationalism can be traced back to the formation of Pakistan in 1947 when the geopolitical reshaping of South Asia led to new national identities and political aspirations. Among the Pashtuns, a significant initial response to the new state of Pakistan was the desire for a separate state—Pashtunistan. This imagined nation was conceived to unite Pashtun areas in both Pakistan and Afghanistan under a single administrative and cultural umbrella. Leaders such as Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan were pivotal in advocating for this cause, believing that Pashtuns needed a separate nation to preserve their unique cultural and social norms, distinct from both Pakistani and Afghan nationalisms (Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, & S. Gul, 2019).

However, over time, the practicalities of international politics and internal dynamics within Pakistan led to a transformation in Pashtun nationalism. By the late 20th century, the focus had shifted from separatism to a struggle for greater rights and recognition within the framework of the Pakistani constitution. This shift was largely influenced by the failure to gain sufficient support for Pashtunistan and the recognition that political engagement within Pakistan could yield more immediate benefits for Pashtun rights and development. The evolution from separatist aspirations to constitutional activism reflects a pragmatic approach to nationalism, aiming to secure tangible improvements in autonomy, rights, and development for Pashtuns within Pakistan (Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, & S. Gul, 2019).

#### Pashtunwali Influence
Pashtunwali, the traditional socio-cultural code of the Pashtuns, has been instrumental in shaping Pashtun nationalism. This ancient code, which governs social interactions and personal conduct through principles like *melmastia* (hospitality), *nanawatai* (asylum), *badal* (revenge), and *tureh* (bravery), provides a foundational sense of identity and unity among Pashtuns. The resilience of Pashtunwali, even in the face of modern state laws and international influences, underscores its profound impact on the collective consciousness of the Pashtun people (Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, & S. Gul, 2019).

Pashtunwali's principles not only foster a strong communal bond but also serve as a political tool. For instance, the concept of *nanawatai* has been used politically to provide sanctuary to those fleeing persecution, aligning with the Pashtun tradition of protecting the oppressed—a principle that resonates deeply with the nationalist narrative of self-determination and resistance against external domination. Furthermore, *badal* reinforces the notion of justice and retribution, which has been a recurring theme in the call for political rights and autonomy, reflecting in the movements against perceived injustices by the state or external forces.

The influence of Pashtunwali in maintaining a sense of unity and identity among Pashtuns has thus been pivotal. It provides not just a cultural framework but also a political language through which Pashtun nationalism articulates demands for rights, recognition, and respect for their traditions within the broader Pakistani polity. This cultural continuity is crucial in understanding how Pashtun nationalism adapts and survives, navigating between the traditional and modern, the local and the national.

This section of the survey paper outlines how historical aspirations for independence have morphed into efforts for greater integration and rights within Pakistan, influenced significantly by the principles of Pashtunwali, which serve both as a cultural bedrock and a political framework for the Pashtun nationalist movement.

### Contemporary Challenges and Shifts

#### Neo-Ethnonationalism
In recent years, Pashtun nationalism has undergone another transformation, aligning with broader global trends towards neo-ethnonationalism. This modern form of nationalism is characterized by its inclusivity and adaptability, incorporating various social groups that were previously marginalized or unengaged in traditional nationalist discourses. Husnul Amin (2023) highlights how this new wave of Pashtun neo-ethnonationalism is not just a resurgence of ethnic pride but is also a strategic adaptation to the changing socio-political landscape in Pakistan.

Neo-ethnonationalism in the Pashtun context involves a more comprehensive embrace of identity politics, reaching out to diverse groups within Pashtun society, including left-leaning intellectuals, Islamists, developmentalists, and modern professionals. This inclusivity reflects a departure from the more rigid, traditional forms of nationalism and is a response to the complexities of modern state dynamics and globalization. By engaging a broader base of support, Pashtun neo-ethnonationalism aims to strengthen its political leverage and address a wider range of socio-economic issues that affect all strata within the Pashtun territories (Husnul Amin, 2023).

The emergence of this neo-ethnonationalism is also a reaction to past failures to achieve political objectives through more conventional nationalist movements. It recognizes the need for a more integrated approach to governance and development that can appeal to the varied needs and aspirations of a diverse population. Thus, neo-ethnonationalism represents a critical evolution of Pashtun nationalism, striving for a more robust and sustainable engagement with both national and international challenges.

#### Impact of Extremism
The landscape of Pashtun nationalism has also been significantly shaped by the rise of religious extremism and the consequential state policies. According to Surat Khan (2019), the impact of religious extremism, particularly the influence of the Afghan Jihad and subsequent militancy, has profoundly affected the dynamics of Pashtun nationalism. The intertwining of religious fervor with ethnic nationalism has led to a complex scenario where traditional nationalist sentiments are often overshadowed by religious ideologies.

The state's policies, particularly those aimed at combating extremism, have had a dual effect on Pashtun nationalism. On one hand, these policies have led to increased militarization and surveillance of Pashtun areas, often resulting in civilian hardships and grievances. On the other hand, the state's focus on curbing religious extremism has sometimes inadvertently weakened traditional nationalist platforms, which were not primarily religious in nature. The decline in traditional nationalist sentiments is a result of the rising prominence of religious groups that wield significant social and political influence, often at the expense of secular nationalist groups.

This overlap of religious extremism with nationalist motives has resulted in a significant shift in how Pashtun nationalism is perceived both within and outside Pashtun communities. The challenge now lies in distinguishing the genuine aspirations for rights and autonomy from the agendas driven by religious extremism. This blurring of lines complicates the efforts to advocate for Pashtun rights under a nationalist banner, necessitating a nuanced approach to understand and support legitimate nationalist claims without empowering extremist elements.

This section of the paper addresses the dual forces shaping contemporary Pashtun nationalism: the adaptive and inclusive trends of neo-ethnonationalism and the disruptive impact of religious extremism facilitated by state policies. Both elements are crucial for understanding the current and future trajectories of Pashtun nationalism, highlighting the need for strategies that effectively integrate traditional values with modern political realities.

### Interplay with Religion and Socio-Political Movements

#### Religious Conflict
The relationship between religious dynamics and nationalism within the Pashtun context is notably marked by the influence of the Taliban, a movement that has intertwined religious and nationalist causes. A. Saikal (2010) critically examines how the Taliban's rise has been shaped by and has shaped Pashtun nationalism, especially under the pressures exerted by external forces like the Afghan and Pakistani governments. The Taliban, initially emerging in the mid-1990s amidst the chaos following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, capitalized on the blend of religious fervor and nationalist sentiment prevalent among Pashtuns, many of whom felt marginalized or threatened by the state policies of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

This fusion of religious and nationalist causes is not merely a convergence but a complex interaction where religious ideologies often dominate the discourse, pushing traditional nationalist motivations to the background. The Taliban's portrayal of their struggle as a defense of Pashtun rights and Islamic values against foreign influences and corrupt local governments resonated with widespread sentiments of disenfranchisement and injustice among Pashtuns. However, this amalgamation has also led to significant challenges. It complicates the international and domestic perception of Pashtun nationalism, often associating it with extremism and terrorism, which undermines legitimate nationalist claims for rights and autonomy (A. Saikal, 2010).

#### Pashtun Tahafuz Movement
In contrast to the religious-nationalist agenda of movements like the Taliban, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) represents a distinctly modern, secular response to the challenges faced by Pashtuns in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Highlighted by N. A. Mir (2018), the PTM emerged as a significant socio-political force advocating for the rights and protection of Pashtuns against what it perceives as state-sponsored violence and discrimination, particularly in the context of the war against terrorism.

The PTM has effectively utilized modern communication tools and social media to mobilize support and gain international attention, advocating for a platform that seeks justice and accountability from the Pakistani military and government. Its rise is a direct response to ongoing political instability, human rights abuses, and the lack of effective civil governance in Pashtun regions. By focusing on issues such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and the de-mining of tribal areas, the PTM highlights systemic issues that affect daily life in the Pashtun belt, distinct from the broader religious-political narratives often associated with the region.

The implications of the PTM for Pashtun nationalism are profound. It represents a reassertion of secular, civic nationalist values within the Pashtun political landscape, providing a counter-narrative to the religious extremism that has overshadowed Pashtun nationalist discourse for decades. This movement has not only reinvigorated discussions about Pashtun identity and rights but also redefined the means through which nationalist sentiments are expressed and mobilized, emphasizing peaceful protest and democratic engagement over armed struggle (N. A. Mir, 2018).

This section of the paper delves into the complex interactions between religious dynamics and nationalist movements among the Pashtuns, highlighting how different movements have responded to external pressures and internal challenges. It underscores the varied strategies Pashtun groups have adopted, from the militancy of the Taliban to the civil activism of the PTM, reflecting the diverse responses to the socio-political conditions impacting Pashtun nationalism today.

### Interplay with Religion and Socio-Political Movements

#### Religious Conflict and the Taliban Influence
The fusion of religious dynamics and nationalism within Pashtun territories, particularly through the influence of the Taliban, represents a critical junction of ideological and political objectives. A. Saikal (2010) provides an in-depth analysis of how the Taliban, initially a movement largely seen as a response to the vacuum left by the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, has increasingly woven nationalist rhetoric with religious fervor to appeal to and mobilize the Pashtun population. This synthesis of religion and nationalism has been further intensified by external pressures, notably the military and political strategies employed by both Afghan and Pakistani governments aimed at countering insurgency.

The Taliban's use of Pashtun nationalism is intricately linked with their religious agenda, portraying their struggle as a defense against foreign domination and corrupt local governance. This narrative has resonated with many Pashtuns who feel marginalized or oppressed by the central authorities. The resulting blend of nationalism and religion complicates the landscape of Pashtun political activism, as it intertwines legitimate demands for ethnic and regional rights with broader Islamic radicalism. This amalgamation poses significant challenges for distinguishing purely nationalist motivations from those driven by religious extremism, impacting how these movements are perceived both domestically and internationally (A. Saikal, 2010).

#### The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM)
In stark contrast to the religious and militant strategies of the Taliban, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) emerges as a predominantly secular and nonviolent campaign focusing on human rights and social justice for Pashtuns, particularly those affected by the war on terror in Pakistan. N. A. Mir (2018) discusses how PTM has gained traction and visibility by addressing grievances related to extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and the displacement caused by military operations in Pashtun regions.

The PTM's rise is a direct response to the ongoing political instability and the perceived failure of both the Pakistani state and traditional militant groups like the Taliban to adequately represent and protect Pashtun interests. By advocating for rights through peaceful protests and leveraging social media platforms, the PTM highlights a shift in Pashtun activism towards more democratic and civic engagement methods. This movement has not only revitalized Pashtun nationalism but also redefined its trajectory by focusing on civil liberties and the rule of law, challenging both the state's authority and the militant groups' influence within Pashtun society.

The implications of the PTM for Pashtun nationalism are profound, as it reflects a critical reassessment of the means through which political and social objectives are pursued. The movement has introduced a new narrative of resistance that separates itself from the religiously motivated militancy that has often overshadowed Pashtun nationalist claims. It underscores a significant reorientation towards nonviolent struggle and a broader engagement with national and international forums to address the Pashtuns' plight (N. A. Mir, 2018).

This section explores the dual aspects of the interplay between religion and socio-political movements among the Pashtuns, contrasting the religious militancy of the Taliban with the secular activism of the PTM. It illustrates how both movements have shaped the discourse of Pashtun nationalism under varying pressures and objectives, reflecting a dynamic and complex field of political struggle.

### Theoretical and Methodological Considerations

#### Debates on Nationalism: Reality or Construct?

The notion of Pashtun nationalism has been a subject of considerable academic debate, with various scholars arguing over its authenticity and construct. R. Saigol (2012) delves into this discussion by questioning whether Pashtun nationalism is an inherent identity or a socio-politically constructed phenomenon. This debate is rooted in the broader theoretical framework of nationalism studies, which distinguishes between 'primordialism' and 'modernism.' Primordialists believe that nationalism is a natural consequence of ancient, deep-rooted feelings of kinship and cultural heritage, whereas modernists view nationalism as a modern construction shaped by socio-political circumstances.

Saigol's work highlights the complexity of Pashtun identity, which encompasses elements that could be seen as both primordial and constructed. The intertwining of the Pashtunwali code with modern political aspirations suggests that Pashtun nationalism is not merely an imagined community in Benedict Anderson's sense but has tangible roots in the lived experiences and historical continuity of the Pashtun people. However, the extent to which external influences, such as colonial legacies and contemporary geopolitical strategies, have shaped this nationalism adds a layer of construction to this identity, indicating a synthesis of intrinsic ethnic bonds and strategic socio-political positioning (R. Saigol, 2012).

#### Comparative Perspectives: Analyzing Ethnonational Movements

When comparing Pashtun nationalism to other ethnonationalist movements within Pakistan, such as those in Balochistan and Sindh, the concept of relative deprivation offers a valuable analytical framework. This theory posits that social groups perceive disparities between their expected and actual socio-economic and political conditions, which can fuel nationalist sentiments. R. Khan (2021) applies this framework to explain the varying trajectories of ethnonationalist movements within Pakistan.

The relative deprivation theory helps to illuminate why certain nationalist movements, like the Bengali nationalism that led to the formation of Bangladesh, have achieved substantial political outcomes, while others like Baloch and Sindhi nationalism have not escalated to the same level. For Pashtuns, the disparities in political representation, economic development, and social recognition compared to their Punjabi counterparts have fostered a sense of deprivation. This deprivation, combined with the historical context of their cross-border existence and their significant role in Afghanistan's political landscape, creates a unique set of challenges and dynamics for Pashtun nationalism.

Moreover, examining these movements through comparative lenses reveals how state policies, regional geopolitics, and international interventions have variably impacted these groups. The success or failure of these movements can often be traced back to how effectively they mobilize resources, articulate grievances, and navigate the political landscape, which in turn is shaped by their relative deprivation and the state's response to their demands (R. Khan, 2021).

This section underscores the complexity of defining and analyzing Pashtun nationalism within both theoretical and comparative frameworks. It not only examines the intrinsic and constructed elements of Pashtun identity but also contextualizes the movement within the broader spectrum of ethnonationalist movements in Pakistan, providing a nuanced understanding of its origins, motivations, and impacts.

### Conclusion

#### Summary of Findings
This survey has explored the multifaceted dimensions of Pashtun nationalism in Pakistan, tracing its evolution from a movement initially rooted in the desire for a separate state to its current manifestations within the constitutional framework of Pakistan. The literature reviewed reveals a complex tapestry of influences shaping this nationalism, including the traditional code of Pashtunwali, the impact of religious dynamics, and the interplay with socio-political movements.

Key insights from the surveyed works highlight the adaptive nature of Pashtun nationalism over time. The transition from separatist aspirations to a focus on rights within Pakistan is a significant shift, as discussed by Surat Khan, Muhammad Faheem, and S. Gul (2019). The emergence of neo-ethnonationalism, as explored by Husnul Amin (2023), reflects a more inclusive approach, engaging diverse groups within Pashtun society and beyond. Additionally, the impact of religious extremism and state policies on Pashtun nationalism has introduced a layer of complexity, often intertwining genuine nationalist sentiments with broader religious and militant agendas, as analyzed by A. Saikal (2010) and R. Saigol (2012).

Moreover, comparative analysis, using frameworks like relative deprivation, sheds light on the unique position of Pashtun nationalism within the broader context of ethnonationalist movements in Pakistan. This comparative perspective helps to understand why some movements have achieved certain political outcomes while others have not, as seen in the work of R. Khan (2021).

#### Future Research Directions
While this survey provides a comprehensive overview of Pashtun nationalism, several areas warrant further exploration to deepen our understanding of its current and future trajectories:

1. **Impact of Global Geopolitics**: Future research could explore how international relations and global geopolitical shifts influence Pashtun nationalism. The roles of neighboring countries, international alliances, and global policy decisions could be examined to understand their impact on the regional nationalist movements.

2. **Role of Digital Media**: The advent of digital media has transformed the landscape of nationalism globally. Studies could focus on how digital platforms are used by Pashtun nationalists to mobilize support, disseminate information, and engage with both local and global audiences. The role of social media in shaping modern Pashtun nationalism, particularly movements like the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, offers a rich field for exploration.

3. **Intersection with Economic Development**: Investigating the correlation between economic development and nationalist sentiments in Pashtun regions could provide insights into how economic factors drive or dampen nationalist movements. This could include studies on the impact of infrastructure projects, foreign investment, and local economic policies on nationalist sentiments.

4. **Comparative Studies with Other Nationalist Movements**: Further comparative studies with other global or regional nationalist movements could provide a broader understanding of how similar movements succeed or fail, offering valuable lessons for Pashtun nationalism.

5. **Longitudinal Studies on Identity Shifts**: Longitudinal research could track changes in the identity and political orientations within the Pashtun population over time, offering insights into the evolving nature of nationalism in response to domestic and international pressures.

By addressing these areas, future research can continue to unravel the complexities of Pashtun nationalism, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of its causes, manifestations, and impacts in the changing political landscape of South Asia and beyond.
