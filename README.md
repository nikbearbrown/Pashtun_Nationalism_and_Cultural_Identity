# Pashtun Nationalism and Cultural Identity: A Historical and Literary Perspective

### Abstract
This survey paper explores the evolution and expressions of Pashtun nationalism through historical and literary lenses, highlighting the influential role of Khushal Khan Khattak. By examining various scholarly works, this paper discusses the interplay between Pashtun cultural codes, poetry, and the broader socio-political movements that shape Pashtun identity in Pakistan.

### Introduction
### Introduction

#### Concept of Pashtun Nationalism

Pashtun nationalism is a cultural and political movement that aims to preserve and promote the unique identity and interests of the Pashtun people, who predominantly reside in the regions straddling modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This form of nationalism is deeply rooted in the historical, linguistic, and cultural distinctiveness of the Pashtun ethnic group, which has maintained a strong tribal structure and a distinct social code known as "Pashtunwali" (Understanding Pashtunwali and the Manifestation of Pashtun Nationalism in Pakistan: A Conceptual Analysis, Surat Khan et al., 2019).

The movement has historically oscillated between demands for greater autonomy within the existing national boundaries to calls for a separate Pashtun state, Pashtunistan. The transformation of Pashtun nationalism over time can be seen in its shift from traditional tribal allegiances to more modern political expressions, including involvement in national politics and international discourse. The resurgence of nationalism, particularly through movements such as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, underscores a contemporary re-evaluation of Pashtun identity against the backdrop of national and global politics (The rise of peripheral nationalism in Pakistan and the Pashtun Tahafuz movement, Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al., 2020).

#### Significance of Khushal Khan Khattak

Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689), often heralded as the national poet of the Afghans, stands as a monumental figure in Pashtun history and culture. His life and works embody the essence of Pashtun nationalism during a tumultuous period marked by his opposition to the Mughal Empire. Khattak was not only a warrior and chieftain but also a prolific poet whose writings significantly contributed to the Pashtun cultural renaissance and helped solidify a collective Pashtun identity ("THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PASHTUN’S AND MUGHAL’S AND THE ROLE OF KHUSHAL KHAN KHATTAK," Muhammad Anees Khan, 2019).

Khushal Khan used poetry as a medium to express his political thoughts and to rally the Pashtuns against the Mughal authority, promoting values of independence and resistance that are central to Pashtun nationalism. His works, rich with themes of honor, valor, and resistance, have transcended generations, influencing Pashtun thought and identity up to the present day. Through his poems, Khushal Khan advocated for Pashtun unity and valor, often invoking the Pashtunwali codes of hospitality, justice, and revenge, which reinforced the socio-cultural fabric of Pashtun society (Humanity in the Poems of Khushal Khan, Abdul Halim Osmani et al., 2023).

Furthermore, Khushal Khan's contributions are not limited to his military and poetic endeavors; he is also noted for his efforts in framing the educational discourse within Pashtun society, advocating for learning and knowledge as tools of empowerment and resistance against oppression (Education as Practice of Emancipation: A Critical Study of Educational Approach of Classical Pashto Poet Khushal Khan Khattak, Dr. Barkat Shah Kakar et al., 2022). His emphasis on education highlights his forward-thinking approach, linking educational pursuits with nationalistic goals.

The enduring legacy of Khushal Khan Khattak in Pashtun nationalism is evident in how his literary works continue to inspire modern movements and discussions about Pashtun identity and autonomy, reflecting the deep historical and cultural roots of the Pashtun nationalist movement. His figure represents not only the historical struggle of the Pashtuns but also their ongoing quest for recognition and rights within larger national and international frameworks.

#### Historical Context of Pashtun Nationalism
#### Historical Context of Pashtun Nationalism

The historical context of Pashtun nationalism is richly intertwined with the region's complex political and military history, particularly in its interactions with the Mughal Empire. The Pashtuns, historically known for their martial prowess and strong adherence to tribal customs, have often been at the center of power struggles in South Asia.

**Conflicts and Alliances between Pashtuns and the Mughal Empire**

During the height of the Mughal Empire, the Pashtuns found themselves both as adversaries and allies to the Mughals, reflecting a relationship that was as tumultuous as it was transformative. The Mughals, under emperors like Akbar, sought to extend their control over the strategically crucial and resource-rich Pashtun territories, which led to a series of military campaigns and resistance from various Pashtun tribes. These military campaigns were often met with fierce resistance, as the tribal and decentralized nature of Pashtun society made prolonged warfare and control challenging for the centralized Mughal authority ("THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PASHTUN’S AND MUGHAL’S AND THE ROLE OF KHUSHAL KHAN KHATTAK," Muhammad Anees Khan, 2019).

The Pashtuns did not only resist; at times, they also formed strategic alliances with the Mughals, particularly when it suited regional interests or when they sought to leverage Mughal power against local rivals. These alliances, however, were often fragile and contingent upon the shifting dynamics of power and diplomacy in the region.

**Role of Khushal Khan Khattak in Promoting Pashtun Nationalism**

Khushal Khan Khattak, a chief of the Khattak tribe, emerged as a pivotal figure during this period. Initially serving the Mughals as a military leader, Khushal Khan’s relationship with the empire soured following personal disputes and broader tribal grievances against Mughal policies, which were perceived as oppressive towards Pashtun autonomy. His dissent marked a significant turning point, as he used his considerable influence, both as a warrior and a poet, to incite resistance against the Mughals.

Khushal Khan's advocacy for Pashtun nationalism was deeply rooted in the traditional code of Pashtunwali, which emphasizes values such as honor, hospitality, and justice. His poems and writings began to articulate a clear sense of Pashtun identity that was distinct from the Mughal influence, rallying his people around the concepts of self-rule and tribal unity. His leadership exemplified the Pashtun resistance narrative, embedding a strong sense of nationalism within the cultural psyche of the Pashtuns.

Khushal Khan's role in promoting Pashtun nationalism cannot be understated; he transformed Pashtun resistance into a broader nationalist movement by intertwining it with cultural and poetic expressions that celebrated Pashtun heritage and valorized its struggle for sovereignty. This period of resistance under his leadership not only fortified Pashtun identity but also laid foundational narratives for future nationalist movements within the Pashtun regions.

In summary, the historical context of Pashtun nationalism is marked by a dynamic interplay of conflict and cooperation with the Mughals, with figures like Khushal Khan Khattak central to the narrative. His efforts in fostering a distinct Pashtun nationalism through both armed resistance and cultural production were instrumental in shaping the trajectory of Pashtun socio-political identity, which continues to influence regional politics to this day. His legacy is reflected in contemporary Pashtun nationalist movements, which still draw on the historical and cultural themes he helped to crystallize.

#### Literary Contributions of Khushal Khan Khattak
#### Literary Contributions of Khushal Khan Khattak

Khushal Khan Khattak is not only celebrated as a pivotal historical figure in the context of Pashtun resistance against the Mughal Empire, but also as a foundational poet whose literary contributions have had a lasting impact on Pashtun culture and nationalism. His poetry and prose are integral to understanding how the Pashtun identity has been articulated, preserved, and transmitted across generations.

**Reflection and Perpetuation of Pashtun Cultural Codes in Khushal Khan's Poetry**

Khushal Khan’s poetry is a rich tapestry of Pashtun cultural codes, encapsulating the ethos of Pashtunwali— the traditional Pashtun social code that emphasizes values such as honor, bravery, and justice. His poetic works serve as a cultural repository, preserving the oral traditions and values of the Pashtun people during a period of significant historical upheaval. As noted by Hameedullah Omarkhel et al. (2023), Khushal Khan's poetry vividly captures and perpetuates these cultural codes, making them accessible and resonant to both contemporary and future generations of Pashtuns.

In his poems, Khushal Khan often uses metaphors and allegories derived from the everyday life and environment of the Pashtun people, thus grounding his nationalist sentiments in the familiar landscapes of his audience. His verses on valor and resistance are not just calls to arms but are deeply intertwined with the Pashtun's fierce pride in their land and traditions. By embedding nationalist ideals in cultural expressions, Khushal Khan's poetry has ensured that Pashtun nationalism is perceived not merely as a political stance but as an inherent part of the Pashtun cultural identity.

**Humanity and Education as Tools for Emancipation**

Khushal Khan also explored themes of humanity and education in his works, viewing them as essential tools for the emancipation of the Pashtuns from oppressive rule and ignorance. As discussed by Abdul Halim Osmani et al. (2023), Khushal Khan believed in the power of education to elevate the human spirit and foster a sense of communal identity and purpose among the Pashtuns. His humanist views are evident in his poetry, where he often speaks of justice, equality, and the importance of knowledge.

Khushal Khan’s emphasis on education went beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge; he saw it as a means of empowering the Pashtun people to stand up against exploitation and to better understand their rights and duties. His poetic works encourage critical thinking and self-reflection, advocating for a literate society where informed and educated individuals could contribute to the welfare and improvement of their communities.

Moreover, Khushal Khan's humanistic approach in his poetry transcends ethnic and tribal lines, advocating for a broader understanding of humanity that includes respect for all people regardless of their background. This universal appeal not only broadened the reach of his literary works but also provided a moral foundation upon which he built his arguments for Pashtun nationalism.

**Conclusion**

Khushal Khan Khattak's literary contributions have had a profound impact on the development of Pashtun nationalism and the preservation of Pashtun culture. Through his poetry, he not only reflected and perpetuated the traditional values of Pashtunwali but also used his literary platform to advocate for education and humanistic values as fundamental components of societal emancipation. His works remain a cornerstone of Pashtun cultural identity, resonating with themes of resistance, education, and humanity that continue to inspire and influence the Pashtun nationalist movement today.

#### Pashtunwali and Modern Nationalism
#### Pashtunwali and Modern Nationalism

The role of Pashtunwali, the traditional Pashtun social code, in shaping modern Pashtun nationalism is profound and multifaceted. Pashtunwali, with its complex set of ethical guidelines, cultural norms, and social obligations, has historically been the cornerstone of Pashtun identity and governance. This section explores how these traditional codes influence contemporary nationalist movements and how new movements have transformed the landscape of Pashtun nationalism.

**Role of Pashtunwali in Contemporary Nationalism Movements**

Pashtunwali is a cultural framework that governs the behavior and decision-making processes within Pashtun societies. It encompasses key principles such as hospitality (melmastia), justice (nang), and personal honor (tor), which have been pivotal in maintaining social order and cohesion among Pashtun tribes for centuries. According to Surat Khan et al. (2019), Pashtunwali not only underpins traditional Pashtun society but also serves as a catalyst for contemporary nationalism movements. The resilience and appeal of Pashtunwali lie in its adaptability and relevance, even amidst the political and social changes brought about by modernity.

This traditional code has significantly influenced the formulation of political ideologies among Pashtuns, often providing a cultural justification for resistance against perceived injustices and foreign domination. Pashtunwali's emphasis on justice and honor directly feeds into the narrative of modern Pashtun nationalism, which frequently frames its objectives in terms of redressing historical grievances and achieving fair treatment within the broader national framework of Pakistan. The cultural legitimacy afforded by Pashtunwali enhances the persuasive power of nationalist rhetoric, appealing to deeply ingrained values and identities.

**Impact of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement**

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a recent and notable example of modern Pashtun nationalism, has brought significant attention to issues facing the Pashtun communities in Pakistan, such as military operations, human rights abuses, and the imposition of external controls over tribal areas. As detailed by Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al. (2020), the PTM has utilized the principles of Pashtunwali to mobilize support and advocate for the rights of Pashtuns. The movement's call for justice and accountability resonates strongly with the traditional Pashtun emphasis on nang and tor, enabling it to garner widespread support among Pashtuns, both within Pakistan and globally.

The PTM's rise is a significant marker of how traditional cultural codes like Pashtunwali can be adapted to frame modern political and social movements. By articulating their demands through the lens of Pashtunwali, the PTM leaders ensure cultural coherence and continuity, which strengthens communal bonds and collective action. The movement's impact extends beyond immediate political goals, as it also prompts a reevaluation of Pashtun identity in the contemporary era, challenging stereotypes and advocating for a nuanced understanding of Pashtun issues in national and international arenas.

**Conclusion**

Pashtunwali continues to be a dynamic and influential force in the articulation and development of Pashtun nationalism. Its principles shape the ethos and strategies of contemporary nationalist movements, providing a cultural foundation that enhances their legitimacy and resonance among Pashtun populations. The interplay between traditional codes and modern political demands, exemplified by movements like the PTM, highlights the adaptability and enduring relevance of Pashtunwali in the face of changing political landscapes. This complex relationship between tradition and modernity in Pashtun nationalism not only sustains a unique cultural identity but also drives the ongoing struggle for rights and recognition within the broader Pakistani state.

#### Nationalism and Religious Identity
### Nationalism and Religious Identity

The relationship between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity is complex and has significant implications for regional stability and politics. This section delves into how Pashtun nationalism intertwines with Islamic identity and the ways this interplay influences conflicts and political dynamics in the region.

**Interplay Between Pashtun Nationalism and Religious Identity**

Pashtun nationalism has historically coexisted with a strong Islamic identity, as the Pashtuns are predominantly Muslim. However, the interaction between these two facets of identity is not straightforward and has been influenced by various political, social, and historical factors. R. Saigol (2012) in "The multiple self: interfaces between Pashtun nationalism and religious conflict on the frontier," discusses how Pashtun identity has been constructed and reconstructed over time, often in response to external pressures and internal dynamics. The paper highlights that while Pashtun nationalism draws on cultural and tribal affiliations, it also intersects significantly with religious elements, which can both unify and divide.

Pashtun nationalism often emphasizes traditional values and codes, such as Pashtunwali, which coexist with Islamic principles. However, the interpretation of Islam within Pashtun areas can vary significantly, leading to internal conflicts and differences in how nationalism is expressed. For example, some groups may prioritize ethnic and tribal allegiances over religious unity, whereas others might view their Islamic identity as inseparable from their nationalistic aspirations. This duality can lead to a fragmented identity, particularly on the frontier regions where state influence is limited, and tribal and religious laws dominate.

**Nationalism and Religious Ideologies: Context of Taliban Support**

The relationship between Pashtun nationalism and the Taliban is particularly illustrative of how religious ideologies can shape and be shaped by nationalistic movements. A. Saikal (2010) in "Afghanistan and Pakistan: The Question of Pashtun Nationalism?" explores how the Taliban, originally seen as a primarily religious movement, has also been interpreted as a form of Pashtun nationalism. The Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan and their continued influence in Pashtun regions of Pakistan are often linked to their ability to appeal to both the religious sentiments and the nationalistic feelings of the Pashtun population.

The Taliban's use of Islamic rhetoric intertwined with calls for justice and Pashtun autonomy resonates with widespread sentiments against perceived foreign intervention and domination. This approach has allowed them to mobilize significant Pashtun support, framing their governance and military actions as a defense of Pashtun rights and Islamic principles. The support for the Taliban in these regions can thus be seen as part of a broader pattern where religious and nationalistic identities are merged to create a powerful political narrative that appeals to deep-seated cultural and religious values.

**Conclusion**

The interplay between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity is a key factor in understanding the political and social dynamics of the Pashtun regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This relationship is characterized by a complex overlay of cultural nationalism and religious fervor, which impacts regional conflicts and the geopolitical landscape. The dual appeal to tribal nationalism and religious ideology allows movements like the Taliban to gain and maintain power, illustrating the potent combination of these two forces in shaping the socio-political environment. As such, any analysis of Pashtun nationalism and its future trajectories must consider the nuanced roles that both cultural and religious identities play in shaping the aspirations and politics of the Pashtun people.

### Conclusion
### Conclusion

#### Enduring Impact of Khushal Khan Khattak on Pashtun Nationalism

Khushal Khan Khattak is more than a historical figure; he is a symbol of Pashtun resilience and nationalism. His literary and military endeavors during the 17th century set a foundation for the identity and cultural pride that define Pashtun nationalism today. Through his poetry, Khushal Khan not only chronicled the life and values of his people but also instilled a strong sense of nationalism by emphasizing Pashtun valor, honor, and independence. His works, as discussed in the survey, continue to resonate, serving as a source of inspiration and a cultural touchstone for the Pashtun people ("The Cultural Codes of Pashto in Khushal Khan’s Poetry" by Hameedullah Omarkhel et al., 2023).

Khushal Khan's advocacy for education and enlightened thought, as reflected in his poems about humanity and social justice, underscores his foresight and his contributions to the intellectual heritage of the Pashtuns ("Humanity in the Poems of Khushal Khan" by Abdul Halim Osmani et al., 2023). These elements have perpetuated his influence, making him not only a national poet but a perennial figure in the discourse on Pashtun identity and autonomy.

#### Contemporary Significance of Pashtun Nationalism

In the contemporary geopolitical landscape of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Pashtun nationalism remains a significant and sometimes contentious force. The movement's roots in the tribal and cultural ethos of Pashtunwali have adapted to modern political contexts, where issues of rights, governance, and national integrity are at the forefront. The rise of movements like the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement highlights this adaptation, showcasing a nationalism that, while rooted in historical grievances, seeks to address contemporary issues such as human rights abuses, political representation, and social justice ("The rise of peripheral nationalism in Pakistan and the Pashtun Tahafuz movement" by Raja Qaiser Ahmed et al., 2020).

Moreover, the interplay between Pashtun nationalism and religious identity continues to influence regional politics, particularly in relation to the Taliban and the broader Islamic movements in the area. The dual identity of religious adherence and ethnic nationalism presents both challenges and opportunities for stability and peace in the region ("Afghanistan and Pakistan: The Question of Pashtun Nationalism?" by A. Saikal, 2010). Understanding this interplay is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to navigate the complex socio-political terrain of these nations.

#### Conclusion

Khushal Khan Khattak's legacy and the ongoing narrative of Pashtun nationalism are deeply interwoven into the fabric of South Asian history and culture. The endurance of this nationalism, influenced by both historical figures like Khushal Khan and contemporary movements, reflects a vibrant and evolving identity that continues to shape and be shaped by the geopolitical dynamics of the region. As this survey has shown, the themes of resistance, autonomy, and identity are not only elements of the past but are active and dynamic forces that will likely influence the future of both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Understanding these dynamics offers not only a glimpse into the soul of the Pashtun people but also insights into the broader challenges and opportunities facing the region today.

### Introduction

Pashtun nationalism, characterized by a distinctive blend of ethnic identity, cultural heritage, and political aspirations, has played a significant role in the sociopolitical landscapes of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rooted deeply in the traditional Pashtun code of life known as Pashtunwali, this form of nationalism not only underscores the community's values and social norms but also influences their political actions and reactions to national and international events. The historical evolution of Pashtun nationalism is marked by its adaptive responses to colonial and post-colonial shifts, significantly impacting the regional politics of South Asia.

The geographical spread of the Pashtuns, straddling the porous borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, has led to a unique dynamic where nationalism interweaves with issues of sovereignty, governance, and cultural autonomy. Historically, the Pashtuns have been central to key political developments in the region, including the formation of the state of Pakistan in 1947 and subsequent political upheavals in Afghanistan, ranging from the Soviet invasion to the rise of the Taliban.

This survey paper aims to synthesize insights from various academic studies that explore different facets of Pashtun nationalism. The relevance of the chosen papers lies in their diverse perspectives on how Pashtun nationalism has manifested and evolved, particularly focusing on its implications within the complex political frameworks of Pakistan and Afghanistan. By examining studies that discuss the interplay of Pashtun nationalism with religious movements, state policies, and international conflicts, this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces shaping Pashtun nationalism and its impact on regional stability.

Significantly, the papers selected for analysis cover a range of topics, including the influence of the traditional Pashtun code, Pashtunwali, on nationalist sentiments, the role of religious extremism in redefining nationalist priorities, and the transformation of nationalist aspirations in response to geopolitical pressures and state policies. Each of these studies contributes to a nuanced understanding of Pashtun nationalism, reflecting its complexity and the varying degrees to which it affects and is affected by regional and international politics.

Through this survey, we will explore how historical grievances, cultural affiliations, and political exigencies have collectively shaped Pashtun nationalism, examining its implications for both the internal dynamics of Pakistan and Afghanistan and their relationships with global powers. This comprehensive approach will not only highlight the inherent tensions and challenges within Pashtun nationalism but also underline its potential as a transformative force in one of the most geopolitically sensitive regions of the world.

### Study Summaries

This section of the survey paper examines two pivotal studies that delve into the complex dynamics of Pashtun nationalism, its roots in the traditional Pashtunwali code, and its interplay with religious influences. These studies contribute significantly to our understanding of how Pashtun nationalism has evolved in response to socio-political changes and external influences in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

- **Year:** 2019
- **Venue:** Global Social Sciences Review
- **Key Findings:** The study conducted by Khan, Faheem, and Gul (2019) provides an in-depth analysis of Pashtunwali, a traditional code that governs social conduct among the Pashtuns and reinforces their sense of identity and unity. The researchers highlight how this age-old system continues to be a cornerstone in nurturing and perpetuating Pashtun nationalism. Initially, in the aftermath of Pakistan's independence, there was a strong sentiment among Pashtun nationalists for creating a separate state. However, over the decades, this aspiration has shifted towards a more integrated approach where Pashtun rights and identities are sought to be protected and promoted within the constitutional setup of Pakistan. This study sheds light on the transformation of Pashtun nationalism from a separatist movement to one that seeks to achieve its goals through political and legal frameworks within the existing state structure.

- **DOI:** [10.31703/gssr.2019(iv-iii).30](https://doi.org/10.31703/gssr.2019(iv-iii).30)
- **Year:** 2019
- **Key Findings:** Surat Khan’s research explores the dual influence of nationalism and religion on the Pashtun society. The study particularly focuses on how various political strategies employed by Pakistan, notably the promotion of the Afghan Jihad, have intensified religious extremism within Pashtun regions. This escalation of religious fervor has, in turn, impacted Pashtun nationalism, often undermining its secular nationalist goals. Khan points out that the intertwining of religious extremism with nationalist sentiments has led to a complex scenario where traditional nationalist aspirations are frequently overshadowed or altered by religious ideologies. This paper is crucial in understanding the challenges Pashtun nationalism faces in maintaining its distinct identity amidst the rising tide of religious extremism influenced by both domestic policies and international conflicts.

### Contribution to Understanding Pashtun Nationalism
Together, these studies offer a nuanced perspective on the factors shaping Pashtun nationalism. The first study provides insight into how traditional codes like Pashtunwali facilitate a unique nationalist sentiment that has adapted over time from seeking total independence to integrating within a larger national framework. The second study complements this by illustrating the challenges posed by the intertwining of religious extremism with nationalist sentiments, influenced heavily by geopolitical strategies. Both studies are indispensable for comprehending the multi-layered nature of Pashtun nationalism, marked by a blend of traditionalism and evolving political contexts. These insights are fundamental in crafting policies and strategies that acknowledge the unique cultural and historical contexts of the Pashtuns, aiming for stability and integration without compromising their nationalist and cultural aspirations.

### Thematic Analysis

The thematic analysis of the selected studies provides a deeper insight into the multifaceted nature of Pashtun nationalism, emphasizing the impact of external influences, the significant shift from separatism to rights advocacy, and the complex role of religion in shaping the nationalist discourse. These themes are crucial for understanding the evolution and current state of Pashtun nationalism in the geopolitical contexts of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

#### Impact of External Influences
The studies reviewed indicate that external political dynamics, particularly Pakistan's state policies and international conflicts, have significantly influenced the trajectory of Pashtun nationalism. For instance, the implementation of strategic depth policies by Pakistan during the Afghan Jihad played a critical role in fostering religious extremism, which in turn impacted nationalist sentiments among the Pashtuns (Khan, 2019). These external influences have not only shaped the political landscape but also altered the nature of nationalist movements within the Pashtun communities. This has led to an ongoing struggle for the Pashtuns to balance their ethnic identity aspirations with the changing regional and international politics. Understanding these external influences is pivotal for analyzing the shifts in nationalist strategies, from militaristic approaches to more constitutional and rights-based advocacies.

#### Shift from Separatism to Rights Advocacy
A recurring theme identified in the literature is the shift from separatist movements toward advocacy for rights and integration within the existing political framework of Pakistan. Initially, Pashtun nationalism was characterized by a strong desire for a separate state, as seen in the early post-independence era. However, over the decades, there has been a notable transition towards seeking rights and recognition within the Pakistani constitution (Khan, Faheem, & Gul, 2019). This shift is primarily attributed to the realization that sustainable and peaceful coexistence within Pakistan could be more beneficial in the long run than the pursuit of an independent state, which might lead to prolonged conflict and instability. This evolution in nationalist strategies underscores a pragmatic approach to achieving political and social goals, emphasizing legal and political means over armed struggle.

#### Role of Religion
The intersection of religion and nationalism plays a pivotal role in shaping the identity dynamics within Pashtun regions, acting as both a unifying and divisive force. Khan's (2019) study on the interplay between nationalism and religion highlights how religious ideologies have been manipulated to either support or undermine nationalist movements. The rise of religious extremism, often fueled by geopolitical strategies and internal policies, has challenged the secular foundations of Pashtun nationalism. This complex relationship between religion and nationalism in the Pashtun context reveals the dual role of religion—it can act as a catalyst for mobilizing nationalist sentiments but also as a tool for political manipulation to divert or suppress these sentiments. Understanding this dual role is crucial for addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities that religion presents in shaping nationalist movements.

### Conclusion
This thematic analysis reveals that Pashtun nationalism is not a monolithic entity but a dynamic and evolving ideology shaped by a myriad of external and internal factors. The impacts of external political dynamics, the strategic shift towards rights advocacy, and the intricate role of religion form the core of understanding the current and future directions of Pashtun nationalism. Each theme not only provides insights into the complexities of nationalist movements but also helps in formulating strategies that recognize and respect the unique cultural and political aspirations of the Pashtuns. Understanding these themes is essential for any political analysis or policy-making process aimed at fostering stability and integration in regions inhabited by Pashtun populations.
### Discussion

The findings from the studies on Pashtun nationalism contribute significantly to the broader discourse on ethnic nationalism globally. By examining the nuances of Pashtun nationalism, we can draw parallels and contrasts with other nationalist movements around the world, providing a richer understanding of how ethnic traditions and modern state policies interact to shape these movements.

**Comparison with Global Nationalist Movements:**
Pashtun nationalism, with its deep roots in the Pashtunwali code, shares similarities with other ethnic nationalist movements that are deeply tied to traditional codes of conduct and social norms, such as the Kurdish nationalism in the Middle East or the Basque nationalism in Spain. These movements similarly integrate ancient cultural practices with contemporary political agendas to forge a cohesive identity and political stance that resists assimilation into dominant national narratives.

However, what distinguishes Pashtun nationalism is how it has navigated the dual challenges of external geopolitical pressures and internal state policies. Unlike some nationalist movements that might lean towards seeking complete independence through secession, Pashtun nationalism has evolved from its initial separatist inclinations to a more rights-based approach within the framework of the existing state, akin to the Quebecois in Canada. This evolution reflects a pragmatic adaptation to the realities of modern state geopolitics, where outright secession is often unfeasible.

**Implications for Global Ethnic Nationalism:**
The shift in Pashtun nationalism from separatism to rights advocacy underlines a critical aspect of modern ethnic nationalism: the need to adapt traditional aspirations to contemporary political landscapes. This adaptation can serve as a model for other ethnic groups globally, highlighting the potential for achieving cultural and political autonomy without necessarily pursuing full political independence, which might lead to conflict or international isolation.

### Conclusion

This survey of Pashtun nationalism has revealed several key insights that enhance our understanding of ethnic nationalism in a complex and interconnected world. First, the resilience and adaptability of Pashtun nationalism in the face of changing political dynamics and external pressures demonstrate the dynamic nature of ethnic nationalism. The transition from separatism to rights advocacy within the Pakistani constitution illustrates a strategic shift that balances traditional nationalist aspirations with pragmatic political realities.

Second, the interplay between traditional codes such as Pashtunwali and modern political movements provides a compelling case study of how ethnic traditions can continue to influence contemporary nationalist agendas. This blending of the old and the new highlights the capacity of ethnic nationalism to evolve while still retaining its distinct identity.

Finally, the implications of these findings suggest several areas for further research. One pertinent area is the impact of contemporary geopolitical changes, such as the withdrawal of international military forces from Afghanistan, on Pashtun nationalism. Another area for exploration could be the role of digital media in shaping the narratives and reach of Pashtun nationalist movements, particularly among the diaspora.

Understanding Pashtun nationalism within the broader discourse of nationalism and identity politics not only enriches our knowledge of regional dynamics in South Asia but also contributes to the global understanding of how ethnic groups can navigate their aspirations within increasingly complex international contexts.

# RoshNayya Movement: Legacy of Pir Roshan

### Survey Paper: "The Roshaniyya Sufi Movement and Its Historical Impact in South Asia"

**Abstract:**
This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century in South Asia. The movement played a significant role in the socio-political and religious landscape of the region, particularly in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. This paper synthesizes various scholarly works to explore the movement's origins, its spiritual and political philosophies, the conflicts it engendered, and its lasting impact on regional culture and society.

**1. Introduction**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, emerged in the early 16th century in the rugged terrains of what is now modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This movement quickly established itself as a significant spiritual, cultural, and socio-political force in South Asia. Bayazid Ansari's teachings and his establishment of the Roshaniyya Sufi order were deeply rooted in the mystical concept of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being). This philosophical doctrine, which suggests that all existence is unified in the divine essence, served as a cornerstone for the movement's spiritual framework and distinguished it from other contemporary Islamic and Sufi movements.

#### 1. **Historical Context and Emergence**

The emergence of the Roshaniyya movement must be understood against the backdrop of a period marked by political fragmentation, religious diversity, and social upheaval in South Asia. The 16th century was a time of considerable conflict and change, with the region experiencing the decline of established powers and the rise of new dynasties, such as the Mughals, who sought to consolidate their rule over the diverse religious and ethnic communities. In this milieu, Sufi movements often played crucial roles as mediators and cultural bridges, providing spiritual guidance and social cohesion to their followers. However, the Roshaniyya movement diverged from the mainstream Sufi orders of the time in its approach to both spiritual teachings and socio-political engagement.

Bayazid Ansari, born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, was initially educated in Islamic sciences and Sufi teachings. He later developed his unique interpretation of Sufism, which he sought to propagate through his establishment of the Roshaniyya order. Unlike other Sufi movements that typically emphasized withdrawal from worldly affairs, Ansari's vision was more activist. He aimed to challenge the prevailing religious orthodoxy and the socio-political structures that he perceived as corrupt and unjust .

#### 2. **Foundational Principles: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

The philosophical underpinning of the Roshaniyya movement, "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being," is a concept that posits a monistic view of existence, where all creation is essentially one with the Divine. This idea, originally articulated by the medieval Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, was further developed by Bayazid Ansari to challenge the dualistic notion of separation between God and creation prevalent in orthodox Islamic theology. Ansari's interpretation emphasized that the divine is not only transcendent but also immanent within every aspect of creation, encouraging a direct, personal experience of the divine presence.

Ansari’s teachings advocated for the realization of the divine within oneself and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge through inner experience rather than external rituals or dogmatic adherence to religious laws. This stance was seen as a direct challenge to the ulema (Islamic scholars) who upheld a more literalist and legalistic interpretation of Islam. The Roshaniyya teachings promoted a mystical approach to understanding the Quran and Hadith, emphasizing allegorical and esoteric meanings over literal ones  .

#### 3. **Challenging Religious Orthodoxy and Socio-Political Norms**

The Roshaniyya movement was not merely a spiritual initiative; it was a radical challenge to both the religious orthodoxy and socio-political norms of its time. By advocating a mystical interpretation of Islam that downplayed the importance of religious authority and legalistic adherence, Bayazid Ansari directly confronted the established religious order. The movement's emphasis on personal spiritual enlightenment threatened the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars who derived their power from their role as interpreters of Islamic law and guardians of religious orthodoxy.

Additionally, the Roshaniyya movement's social and political ideas were revolutionary for their time. Bayazid Ansari envisioned a society where spiritual and temporal authority were united under a single moral and mystical framework. This vision included a critique of both the tribal chieftains and the burgeoning Mughal state, whom he saw as corrupt and oppressive. His movement attracted followers from various social strata, including marginalized tribal groups, by offering an alternative vision of community that transcended existing social hierarchies and political allegiances .

The movement’s socio-political activism also manifested in its direct confrontation with local rulers and tribal leaders who opposed Ansari's teachings and perceived the growing influence of the Roshaniyya movement as a threat to their power. This conflict escalated into armed confrontations, marking the movement as one of the few Sufi orders that not only engaged in spiritual discourse but also in active socio-political struggle .

#### 4. **Broader Cultural Implications and Legacy**

The Roshaniyya movement had profound cultural implications that extended beyond its immediate religious and political influence. It played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and literary landscape of the Pashtun regions. The movement's teachings were disseminated not only through oral transmission but also through the development of a distinctive literary tradition. Bayazid Ansari himself authored several works in Pashto, thereby contributing to the development of Pashto literature and cultural identity.

Moreover, the movement's emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual discourse challenged the dominance of Persian and Arabic, which were the languages of the elite and the scholars. This helped elevate the status of the Pashto language and facilitated a broader cultural awakening among the Pashtun tribes. The Roshaniyya movement's promotion of Pashto as a literary and scholarly language had lasting effects on the cultural identity of the region, fostering a sense of unity and distinctiveness among its people .

In conclusion, the Roshaniyya Sufi movement represents a unique chapter in the history of South Asian Islam, blending spiritual mysticism with socio-political activism. It challenged both the religious orthodoxy and the socio-political status quo of its time, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence the cultural and religious landscape of the region.


**2. Origins and Foundational Principles**

### Expanded Section: Origins and Foundational Principles

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a prominent Sufi mystic whose life and teachings significantly shaped the religious landscape of South Asia in the 16th century. Born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, Ansari was exposed to diverse religious and cultural influences from an early age. He received a traditional Islamic education but soon diverged from orthodox teachings, developing his unique interpretation of Sufism, which emphasized direct spiritual experience and personal enlightenment over formal religious rituals and dogma.

#### 1. **The Founding of the Roshaniyya Sufi Order**

The Roshaniyya Sufi order, established by Bayazid Ansari in the first half of the 16th century, was rooted in his desire to promote a mystical understanding of Islam that transcended the rigid orthodoxy of his time. The name "Roshaniyya," derived from the Persian word "Roshani" meaning "light" or "illumination," reflects Ansari's emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and the inner illumination of the soul. This movement was part of a broader trend in Sufism that sought to internalize spiritual practices and focus on the individual's direct relationship with the divine, unmediated by clerical authority.

Ansari's establishment of the Roshaniyya order marked a significant departure from other Sufi orders, such as the Qadiriyya or the Chishtiyya, which were more established and widely accepted within the Islamic world. While these orders also emphasized love and devotion to God, they generally operated within the boundaries of orthodox Sunni Islam. In contrast, the Roshaniyya movement was more radical in its approach, questioning the prevailing socio-religious norms and advocating for a more personal and direct experience of God .

**Supporting Quote:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .

#### 2. **Philosophical Underpinnings: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

Central to the Roshaniyya Sufi order's teachings was the doctrine of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being." This philosophy, which was originally articulated by the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi, posits that all existence is fundamentally one with the divine essence. In other words, every aspect of creation is a manifestation of a single, unified divine reality. Ansari adopted and adapted this concept to develop his mystical framework, emphasizing that the divine is both immanent and transcendent, present in all things yet beyond all things.

This philosophical stance was revolutionary in its implications. It suggested that the divine could be experienced directly by anyone who sought it with sincerity and devotion, without the need for intermediaries like religious scholars or clerics. This was a direct challenge to the religious establishment, which derived much of its authority from its role as the gatekeeper of religious knowledge and practice .

By promoting "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," Ansari encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge through personal introspection, meditation, and self-purification. He taught that the divine presence could be realized within oneself and that true spiritual enlightenment came from recognizing this inner divinity. This teaching was seen as a threat to the established religious order because it diminished the role of external religious rituals and the authority of the clergy, who were often seen as intermediaries between the layperson and the divine .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's foundation was deeply spiritual, focusing on personal enlightenment and mystical experiences as a path to understanding the divine nature of existence. This emphasis on direct experience of the divine was a key characteristic that set the Roshaniyya movement apart from more orthodox Islamic practices, which often emphasized external rituals and adherence to religious law.

### Expanded Section: The "Roshaniyya Movement": A Revolutionary Spiritual and Social Initiative

The "Roshaniyya Movement," founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, represented a bold and revolutionary departure from the established socio-religious norms of its time. This movement was not just an introduction of a new Sufi order but a radical initiative that sought to transform both the spiritual consciousness and the socio-political dynamics of the region. Ansari's vision was deeply intertwined with his critique of the existing religious and social order, which he perceived as corrupt, oppressive, and spiritually bankrupt. 

#### 1. **Challenging the Socio-Political Structures**

Bayazid Ansari's establishment of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was driven by his desire to challenge the entrenched socio-political structures of his time, which he believed hindered true spiritual enlightenment and societal justice. Ansari's teachings critiqued the prevailing power dynamics that favored a small elite—both religious and political—over the general populace. He argued that these elites maintained their control through a rigid interpretation of Islam that emphasized external ritual and compliance with religious laws, rather than personal spiritual development and a direct relationship with the divine.

Ansari viewed these structures as inherently corrupt and sought to dismantle them through a spiritual and social revolution. He taught that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved by breaking free from the constraints imposed by religious orthodoxy and social hierarchies. This involved rejecting the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars (ulema) who were seen as gatekeepers of religious knowledge and were often aligned with political authorities to maintain the status quo .

The "Roshaniyya Movement" was characterized by its dual focus on spiritual and socio-political ideals. On the spiritual front, Ansari promoted a more inclusive and accessible interpretation of Islam that was oriented towards personal enlightenment and direct experience of the divine. This stood in stark contrast to the formalistic and hierarchical approaches prevalent in the established religious institutions of the time, which often emphasized strict adherence to ritual and law over personal spiritual development.

On the socio-political front, the movement advocated for a reformation of societal practices and norms. Ansari's teachings emphasized principles of social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of the region.

#### 3. **Inclusivity and Accessibility in Religious Practices**

One of the revolutionary aspects of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was its emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility in religious practices. Ansari believed that spiritual knowledge and divine experience should not be confined to a privileged few but should be accessible to all, regardless of their social or economic status. This approach was in stark contrast to the prevailing religious practices, which were often characterized by exclusivity and a focus on outward piety and ritual.

Ansari's teachings encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge directly from the divine source, rather than through intermediaries such as clerics or religious scholars. This was a radical departure from the norms of the time, which placed significant power in the hands of religious authorities who controlled access to religious knowledge and practices. By advocating for a direct, personal relationship with the divine, Ansari empowered individuals to take ownership of their spiritual journey, breaking down the barriers that had traditionally kept religious knowledge and experience out of reach for many .

Ansari's teachings were grounded in the belief that all human beings are equal before God, and that social and economic inequalities were artificial constructs that needed to be dismantled. He criticized the social stratification and the caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of his time, arguing that these divisions were contrary to the principles of Islam, which advocated for equality and justice .

Ansari's call for social reform was not just theoretical; it had practical implications for the way his followers organized their communities and interacted with others. The movement encouraged its followers to engage in selfless service, cultivate humility, and treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their social or economic status. This emphasis on social justice and equality resonated with many who were marginalized by the existing socio-political structures, and it helped to attract a diverse following to the movement .

#### 4. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization**

### Expanded Section: Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization

A central theme in Bayazid Ansari's teachings within the Roshaniyya Sufi movement was his profound critique of the prevailing religious orthodoxy. Ansari's approach represented a significant departure from the dominant Islamic scholarly traditions of his era, which were characterized by a rigid, formalistic interpretation of religion that prioritized outward conformity and strict adherence to ritual and dogma. Ansari, however, championed an alternative path focused on self-realization and direct experience of the divine, emphasizing inner spiritual understanding over external religious practices. This advocacy for a more personal and experiential approach to spirituality directly challenged the established religious authorities and resonated deeply with those who felt marginalized by orthodox Islam.

#### 1. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy: A Challenge to Established Authority**

Bayazid Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy was rooted in his observation that the Islamic scholarly community of his time had become overly concerned with maintaining external forms of piety, such as ritual observance and adherence to religious law, often at the expense of cultivating a genuine inner spiritual life. Ansari believed that this rigid formalism resulted in a superficial understanding of Islam, one that emphasized compliance over spiritual growth and personal connection with the divine .

Ansari criticized this approach for being spiritually hollow and disconnected from the true essence of Islam, which he saw as a path to personal enlightenment and inner purification. He argued that the religious establishment's focus on external forms and legalistic interpretations served to maintain their power and control over the faithful, rather than fostering genuine spiritual development. In his view, the religious scholars (ulema) had become gatekeepers of a version of Islam that was more concerned with preserving social order and their own authority than with guiding believers toward true spiritual understanding .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .
- "The study presents a balanced and analytical approach of the teachings and techniques he adopted to propagate among the masses" .

**Reasoning:**
By critiquing the established religious orthodoxy, Ansari directly confronted the power structures of his time, advocating for a return to a more authentic, spiritually focused practice of Islam.

#### 2. **Advocacy for Self-Realization and Direct Experience of the Divine**

Central to the teachings of the Roshaniyya movement was the idea that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved through self-realization and direct, personal experience of the divine. Ansari believed that each individual had the potential to experience God directly, without the need for intermediaries such as clerics or scholars. This emphasis on personal spiritual experience was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time, which often relied on a hierarchical model where religious knowledge and authority were concentrated among the ulema .

Ansari taught that the divine could be found within oneself, and that the path to spiritual enlightenment involved turning inward, seeking the divine presence through meditation, contemplation, and inner purification. This approach was inherently egalitarian, as it suggested that anyone, regardless of their social status or level of religious learning, could achieve spiritual enlightenment through sincere devotion and self-discipline. This was a stark contrast to the prevailing views that emphasized external conformity and adherence to a rigid set of religious laws and rituals as the primary means of religious observance .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

**Reasoning:**
By advocating for self-realization and a direct relationship with the divine, Ansari's teachings offered a more personalized and accessible path to spiritual fulfillment, challenging the established religious norms and appealing to a broader range of followers.

#### 3. **Appeal to Marginalized Communities: Inclusivity and Empowerment**

Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy and his advocacy for self-realization found a receptive audience among those who felt alienated by the formalism and exclusivity of orthodox Islam. His teachings particularly resonated with marginalized communities who were often excluded from the centers of religious and political power. By offering a path to divine understanding that did not depend on formal religious education or adherence to rigid social hierarchies, the Roshaniyya movement provided these communities with a sense of spiritual empowerment and inclusion .

For many, the movement's emphasis on inner spiritual experience over outward ritual offered a way to reclaim their spiritual agency in a religious landscape dominated by scholars and clerics who often acted as gatekeepers to religious knowledge. This appeal to the marginalized was further strengthened by the movement's emphasis on social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions, which were prevalent in the region's tribal societies. Ansari's message of spiritual and social liberation thus found fertile ground among those who were most disillusioned with the existing socio-religious order .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's focus on inclusivity and direct spiritual experience made it particularly appealing to those who were disenfranchised by the prevailing religious and social systems, helping to broaden its base of support.

#### 4. **Impact on Religious Thought and Practice: A New Paradigm**

The Roshaniyya movement's critique of religious orthodoxy and its advocacy for self-realization had a profound impact on religious thought and practice in the region. By challenging the authority of the religious scholars and promoting a more direct, personal relationship with the divine, the movement offered a new paradigm for understanding Islam that was more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This new approach emphasized personal spiritual development over outward conformity, encouraging believers to seek a deeper, more meaningful connection with God .

This shift in focus from external ritual to inner experience represented a significant change in the way religion was understood and practiced. It encouraged a more individualized approach to faith, one that was less dependent on the mediation of religious authorities and more focused on personal spiritual growth. This had the effect of democratizing religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a wider range of people and fostering a more inclusive and spiritually dynamic religious community .

By challenging the established religious authorities and promoting a more direct, personal approach to spiritual experience, Ansari's teachings offered a new way of understanding and practicing Islam that was both more inclusive and more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This emphasis on personal spiritual growth and inner purification helped to democratize religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a broader range of people and providing a powerful alternative to the rigid formalism of orthodox Islam.

#### 5. **Impact and Spread of the Movement**

### Expanded Section: Impact and Spread of the Movement

The Roshaniyya movement, initiated by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, quickly garnered a substantial following among various ethnic and tribal groups in South Asia, particularly among the Pashtuns. The movement’s rapid spread can be attributed to several key factors, including Ansari's charismatic leadership, the revolutionary nature of his teachings, the strategic use of vernacular languages, and the movement's appeal to marginalized communities. These elements combined to create a powerful, grassroots spiritual movement that not only challenged the religious and social norms of the time but also left a lasting legacy in the region’s cultural and religious landscape.

#### 1. **Charismatic Leadership and Revolutionary Teachings**

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a charismatic leader whose revolutionary ideas attracted a diverse array of followers. His teachings emphasized personal spiritual enlightenment, direct experience of the divine, and a critique of the established socio-political and religious orders. This combination of spiritual and social reform was particularly appealing to the Pashtuns, who were the primary ethnic group that rallied around Ansari's vision.

The Pashtuns, living in the tribal areas of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, were drawn to Ansari’s teachings because they resonated with their own experiences of marginalization and their desire for both spiritual and social autonomy. Ansari’s emphasis on equality, social justice, and a more personal, direct relationship with the divine challenged the existing power structures, both religious and political, that often excluded or oppressed them. His ideas provided a framework for resistance against external domination and internal hierarchies, appealing to the Pashtun ethos of independence and self-determination .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s appeal to the Pashtuns and other marginalized groups was not just spiritual but also political, offering a vision of society that was more inclusive and just.

#### 2. **Oral Transmission and Written Works in Pashto**

A critical factor in the spread of the Roshaniyya movement was the use of both oral transmission and written works to disseminate Ansari’s teachings. Oral transmission was a powerful tool in a largely illiterate society, allowing the movement’s ideas to be communicated directly to the people in their own language. Ansari and his followers used poetry, songs, and stories to spread their message, making it accessible to a wide audience. This approach not only ensured the rapid spread of the movement but also helped to build a strong sense of community and shared purpose among its followers .

In addition to oral transmission, Ansari made strategic use of written works in Pashto to solidify the movement’s influence and ensure its legacy. By choosing to write in Pashto, a vernacular language, rather than in Arabic or Persian, which were the languages of the religious and cultural elite, Ansari made a deliberate statement about the accessibility of spiritual knowledge. This decision was significant in challenging the dominance of Arabic and Persian, which were often seen as gatekeepers of religious authority and scholarly prestige .

**Supporting Quotes:**

#### 3. **Emphasis on Vernacular Languages: Challenging Elite Dominance**

The Roshaniyya movement’s emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual teachings was a revolutionary approach that significantly contributed to its spread and impact. At the time, Arabic and Persian were the dominant languages of religious scholarship and were associated with the elite class of Islamic scholars (ulema) and rulers. These languages were often inaccessible to the common people, who spoke their local vernaculars, such as Pashto. By advocating for the use of Pashto in spiritual discourse, Ansari effectively challenged the linguistic hegemony of Arabic and Persian, making religious knowledge more accessible and inclusive .

This emphasis on vernacular languages was not merely a linguistic choice; it was a deliberate political and spiritual strategy aimed at breaking down the barriers that excluded ordinary people from religious and spiritual discourse. It allowed Ansari to communicate directly with the people in their own language, fostering a deeper connection and resonance with his teachings. This approach helped to democratize religious knowledge, empowering those who had been marginalized by the existing socio-religious structures and enabling a more inclusive spiritual community .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

The use of vernacular languages like Pashto in spiritual teachings allowed the movement to reach a broader audience, including those who were often excluded from formal religious education, thus fostering a more inclusive and egalitarian spiritual community.

#### 4. **Grassroots Appeal and Empowerment of Marginalized Communities**

A key factor in the rapid spread of the Roshaniyya movement was its strong grassroots appeal, particularly among marginalized communities who found solace and empowerment in Ansari’s teachings. The movement’s message of spiritual and social liberation resonated with those who felt disenfranchised by the rigid hierarchies of the time, both religious and social. By emphasizing self-realization, direct experience of the divine, and the importance of inner spiritual purity over external ritual, the movement offered a path to spiritual fulfillment that was accessible to all, regardless of social status or formal religious training .

This grassroots appeal was a key factor in the movement's rapid spread and its ability to attract a diverse following. The Roshaniyya movement became a vehicle for social change, promoting values of equality, justice, and spiritual autonomy that resonated deeply with its followers .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya movement's advocacy for direct spiritual experience and self-realization was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time" .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s focus on inclusivity, equality, and spiritual empowerment helped to attract a broad cross-section of society, making it a powerful force for social and spiritual change in the region.

#### 5. **Lasting Legacy and Cultural Impact**

The impact of the Roshaniyya movement extended beyond its immediate spiritual and social influence to leave a lasting legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The movement’s promotion of Pashto as a language of spiritual discourse not only helped to elevate the status of Pashto in the region but also contributed to the development of a distinctive Pashto literary tradition. By fostering a sense of cultural pride and identity among its followers, the Roshaniyya movement helped to shape the cultural and religious consciousness of the Pashtun people .

The movement’s teachings on social justice, equality, and spiritual autonomy continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about Islam and society, highlighting its enduring relevance.

By challenging the existing religious and social hierarchies and promoting a more inclusive and accessible path to spiritual enlightenment, the movement attracted a diverse following and left a profound legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The Roshaniyya movement remains a powerful example of how spiritual and social reform can intersect to create lasting change and inspire future generations.
